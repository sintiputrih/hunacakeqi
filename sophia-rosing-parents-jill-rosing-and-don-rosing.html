One of its students, Sophia Rosing was recorded using racial slurs against Kylah Spring, a Black student who was working an overnight shift at the Lexington campus. Sophia is seen barely able to stand as she tries to hit Kylah after being denied entry to Boyd Hall for failing to show her ID. Following this drunken episode, Sophia has been not only fired from her internship and possibly from the university too but she was also arrested on public intoxication, assault, and disorderly conduct charges. The next day in court, Sophia pleaded not guilty to all charges, and in the exclusive pictures obtained by DailyMail.com, from that day, her parents were seen leaving the courtroom.</p><p>So, to those wondering who her parents are, let us tell you all about them in the rest of the writing.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Sophia Rosing’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Sophia Rosing’s parents are Jill and Don Rosing. She came into their lives as a baby ‘Sophia Nicole Rosing’ in 2000. She&nbsp;reportedly grew up with them in a modest three-bedroom and two-bathroom family property in Fort Mitchell.</p><h3><strong>Meet Sophia Rosing’s Mother, Jill Rosing</strong></h3><p>Sophia’s mother Jill’s full name is Jill Christina Algie Rosing. She is the daughter of (mom) Jean Fromeyer Algie who died aged 72 on 23 April 2005 and (dad) Eugene Andrew Algie who died at the age of 85 on 15 June 2011. Also known as Gene, the latter was a hardworking, dedicated family man who enjoyed traveling with his family.</p><p>In her family, Sophia has three older sisters namely Karen Algie Harkins, Janis Algie Donovan, and Shelia Algie Prew, and three older brothers namely Jeff Algie, Doug Algie, and Glenn Algie.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Jill Rosing Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jill Rosing was born in December 1967. So, she was 54, three years younger than her husband, when Sophia was caught on camera hurling racial slurs in 2022.</p><p>The next day after the event, she and her husband attended Sophia’s arraignment and paid their daughter’s $10,000 bond.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Jill Rosing Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jill Rosing graduated from Notre Dame Academy in Park Hills, Kenton County in 1985. But, it was not known what she did with her degree afterward.</p><p>In 1988, her brother Glenn too earned his law degree from the University of Kentucky in Lexington. So, this kind of suggests that their parents were pretty serious when it came to their kids’ education.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Jill Rosing On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jill Rosing was not anywhere on social media including Instagram as of 2022.</p><h3><strong>Meet Sophia Rosing’s Father, Don Rosing</strong></h3><p>Sophia Rosing’s father goes around by his full name Paul Donald Rosing Jr. or just Donny or Don.</p><p>He is the son of (mom) JoAnn Haggard Rosing who died aged 74 at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Florence on 11 December 2015 and (dad) Paul Donald “Don” Rosing Sr. who died aged 82 at the Woodcrest Nursing Home in Elsmere, Kenton County on 17 June 2020.</p><p>Don also lost his sister, Peggy Lynn Rosing Disibio on 27 September 2022, when she died at the age of 59. Long before this, his other sister Susan Marie Rosing Kramer, 50, too breathed her last air on 16 January 2010 at St. Elizabeth Health Care in Edgewood, Kenton County.</p><p>Don now has younger sisters Jill and Beverly Rosing Furnish. He is respectively 3 and 4 years older than them. Also, Don’s younger brother Christopher John Rosing was born in 1975.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Don Rosing Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Don Rosing was born in April 1964. So, he reached the age of 58 in 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Don Rosing Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Professionally, Don Rosing works as an IT executive at Messer Construction Co based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Messer, as it claims, provides unmatched leadership of complex, commercial construction projects. He joined the company in 2012 as the ‘manager of infrastructure’.</p><p>Previously, i.e., from 1991 to 1995, he worked at Kenton County Public Library in Covington, Kenton County as a network computer technician. Then, from&nbsp;1995 to 2001, he was a senior system engineer at Angstrom Technologies in Florence, Boone County, Kentucky.</p><p>His otherwise in existence LinkedIn account had been deleted by the time of this writing.</p><p>About his education, it’s been told that he graduated from Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights, Campbell County, Kentucky.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Don Rosing On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Like his wife, Don Rosing was also not on Instagram and other social media platforms as of 2022.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Do Sophia Rosing’s Parents Live?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Not only Sophia Rosing but also her parents were living in Fort Mitchell, Kenton County since always when her video of her drunken rage went viral on the internet. Fort Mitchell, if you already don’t know, is a home rule-class city in Kenton County, Kentucky, in the United States.</p><p>As for Sophia’s mother, aside from Fort Mitchell, she has also lived in other parts of Kentucky including Covington and Elsmere.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Many Kids Do Sophia Rosing’s Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Sophia Rosing’s parents seemingly have three kids, i.e. including her.</p><p>Paul Donald Rosing III is their eldest as he was born in 1990 in Campbell County, Kentucky. That makes him 32 years old by 2022.</p><p>Next in line is Sophia’s older sister Vanessa Jean Rosing. She was born in May 1993 in Independence, Kentucky. So, she turned 29 years old in 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Are Sophia Rosing’s Parents Still Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Sophia Rosing’s parents were still married as of the time of this writing.</p><p>It was 1 July 1989 when they tied the knot&nbsp;in Kenton County.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrKegnbaiedGoqqKml2K9or7Ep6usZZqeua150aiqoqaXYq6vsIydpqdloqTAqrrGaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lauren-sanchez-patrick-whitesell-havent-been-solid-for-a-while.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren Sanchez, Patrick Whitesell Havent Been Solid for a While">&larr;
