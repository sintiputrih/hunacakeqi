The legal complaint was dismissed with prejudice on Wednesday. Migos is mad and sue-y no more.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkqeejg100193g6gm1muooat@published data-word-count=91>Atlanta rap group <a href=#>Migos</a> is suing their longtime attorney, Damien Granderson, in a multimillion-dollar malpractice lawsuit. <a href=#>Per Rolling Stone</a>, the trio claims that Granderson took “excessive fees” from them and failed to disclose potential conflicts of interest regarding Granderson’s representation of their label, Quality Control Music, which signed Migos in 2013. In the lawsuit, <a href=#>Quavo</a> (Quavious Marshall), <a href=#>Offset</a> (Kiari Cephus), and Takeoff (Kirsnick Ball) claim that they were “cheated out of millions of dollars by those individuals who the group hired to look out for it and its members’ best interests.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcoapy0l001k3h68icryn9al@published data-word-count=75>The lawsuit names Granderson as well as his law firm, Granderson Des Rochers, LLP, and his former firm, Davis Shapiro Lewit Grabel & Leven, LLP,&nbsp;as defendants. The trio alleges that Granderson “abused his position of trust” and that he engaged in “one-sided deals that benefited Granderson and Granderson’s higher priority client, Quality Control Music (‘QCM’). Unbeknownst to Migos, Granderson’s representation of QCM created an incurable conflict of interest and Granderson’s primary loyalty was to QCM.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcoaw4b2001x3h68u3ncpr88@published data-word-count=76>The suit mentions an exclusive distribution deal that QCM had with Capital Records that ultimately led to Granderson “profiting far more handsomely than was apparent from the face of the documents that Granderson presented to Migos for immediate execution.” An amendment was made to the Capital Records deal in 2018 that Migos claims “triggered an extension of the exclusive recording agreement between QCM and Migos, which Granderson knew to contain terms that were unconscionable for Migos.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcob1n1l00243h68h3j03sgi@published data-word-count=112>QCM CEO Pierre “Pee” Thomas took to Instagram on Wednesday night to maintain QCM’s innocence. “It is unfortunate that the same people that we have worked hard for, provided opportunities for, and championed for are now alleging that we have participated in any kind of immoral or unfair business practices or took advantage of them and their careers,” wrote Thomas. “We have always practiced honest business and complete transparency from the beginning when we started Quality Control Music. We built this business on family values, which has been so hard to do when you are dealing with so much pride and ego.” “<a href=#>Bad and Boujee</a>?” More like mad and sue-y (I’m sorry).</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It is unfortunate that the same people that we have worked hard for,provided opportunities for, and championed for are now alleging that we have participated in any kind of immoral or unfair business practices or took advantage of them and their careers, especially while we are dealing with the death of an artist on our label that was dear to us. We have always practiced honest business and complete transparency from the beginning when we started Quality Control Music. We built this business on family values, which has been so hard to do when you are dealing with so much pride and ego. The problem that I have been struggling with in this business as black man is jealousy, hate, division, and lack of communication. I was a millionaire before I got in the music business and for me to know the sacrifices I have made for the people that I have invested in and put every dollar, blood, sweat, and tears into is nonsense. I will not stand by and let Quality Control Music’s reputation and everything we have built and sacrificed be tarnished by allegations of unfair and unjust business practices. I am a student of this game and I have watched several black record label owner’s get destroyed by the same things that I am facing right now. This is why majority of the people in this business end up in financial turmoil and ultimately failing to reach their full potential. It is hard enough to be fighting and battling with corporations and the powers that be, I am not doing it with those who I consider family. I love my artists and I love my team. Everyone has their own lawyers. I understand in this business that you are not always going to end with the people you started with. I say that to say, I am not forcing anybody to be in business with us that has a problem and cannot communicate and does not want to work as a unit. Everything is negotiable. I wish my whole team more money, more blessings, and continued success. #longlivemarlo🙏🏾</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by @<a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px> qcmceo_p</a> on Jul 15, 2020 at 4:18pm PDT</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck7aviqti00rw1my6dajnn3lw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Watch Offset’s Acting Debut on NCIS (and Hear His Unreleased Track ‘Danger’)</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Migos Drop Malpractice Lawsuit Against Longtime Attorney</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdgZ3yutcaoqmarpZrAbrjOp56toZ2aeqLA06ipp52pYrOwvoymmKWoopawtbXCnmSmoZyhtrC6jJ2mpaSRp3upwMyl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./see-what-joel-mchale-looked-like-in-the-nineties-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See What Joel McHale Looked Like in the Nineties">&larr;
