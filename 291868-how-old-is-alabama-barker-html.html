She takes after her dad's knack for entertainment, and as a teenager, she already has a platform with a high number of internet users.</p><p class=dh>The young lady is the last child of Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker and his ex-wife, Shanna Moakler. Their firstborn is a boy named Landon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/16dd50e0b61348f39bd187255426632e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Alabama Luella Barker attends the AMIRI Autumn-Winter 2022 Runway Show on February 08, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7977523/>Alabama</a>, the former couple's youngest child, is a social media influencer and singer, and she possesses the confidence of an adult. Since 2006, she has been facing the camera, starring as herself in various features.</p><p class=dh>The teenage TV star's dad recently made more buzz in the news. This was because the two-time divorcee married Kourtney Kardashian, leading him to become her first and only husband.</p><p class=dh>The couple celebrated their union for the third time in an elegant wedding ceremony in Portofino, Italy. Family and friends, including the entire Kardashian-Jenner brood, as well as Barker's kids, Landon, Alabama, and their step-sibling, Atiana, were present.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/54a3b70ecf301b9d2a86229333d8b223.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Alabama Barker, Atiana De La Hoya, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are seen out in Portofino on May 20, 2022 in Portofino, Italy. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The bride's kids, Mason, Penelope, and Reign, from her former relationship with Scott Disick, also joined in the couple's celebration of love.</p><p class=dh>The pair dated for about a year before having their perfect moment as husband and wife. They had longed for a time when they would share their vows and eventually blend their families.</p><p class=dh>Fans would recall the reality TV star gushing about her relationship with Travis on "The Kardashians." She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kourtney-kardashian-travis-barkers-italian-wedding-photos/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I feel like I'm living in a fairy tale. I couldn't have dreamed of anything more perfect. I've never in my whole life dreamt of getting married until Travis and until this relationship."</p><p class=dh>Thankfully, her husband's kids, as well as her own, are in support of the fairytale romance. This union makes fans wonder who Travis's kids are, especially the most popular and youngest among them allâ€”Alabama.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HOW OLD IS ALABAMA BARKER?</strong></p><p class=dh>Alabama <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7977523/>was born</a> as Alabama Luella Barker in Calabasas, California. Her parents welcomed her a few hours before Christmas: on December 24, 2005, making her a Capricorn.</p><p class=dh>Judging by her zodiac sign, the 16-year-old is already exhibiting the rightful traits of a Capricorn: she is ambitious and persistent. Although there is no current tag on her net worth, she is a social media goddess with massive followers.</p><p class=dh>Another noteworthy fact about her is the meaning behind her unique name. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popbuzz.com/celeb/alabama-barker/>According</a> to Travis, he was inspired by his favorite movie "True Romance," where a character played Alabama Whitman.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALABAMA BARKER'S FAMILY</strong></p><p class=dh>As mentioned earlier, Alabama is not the only child of her parents. She has two other siblings. Her brother, Landon, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/1919313/kourtney-kardashian-husband-travis-barker-who/>was born</a> in 2003. He is a musician and social media influencer.</p><p class=dh>Her half-sister, Atiana De La Hoya, is the eldest of the brood. She was a product of Moakler's relationship with her ex-lover, Oscar De La Hoya.</p><p class=dh>The family's patriarch, Travis, is a notable drummer, musician, label owner, entrepreneur, and actor. However, he is not the only famous face in the household.</p><p class=dh>His ex-wife, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/who-is-shanna-moakler-4331460/>Moakler</a>, is also a well-known personality in the entertainment industry. She is a model and an actress. The mother-of-three was married to Travis from 2004 to 2008.</p><p class=dh>Following news of her ex-husband's romance with Kardashian, the model expressed that she finds their PDA odd. She has also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/photo-gallery/48262929/embed/48262943/Landon-Asher-Barker>displayed</a> her disapproval by liking a fan's comment that hinted that Travis made a downgrade with his new lover.</p><p class=dh>Before their divorce, the former couple and their kids spent time with the Kardashians. They were so close that they even featured in the initial episodes of "KUWTK."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALABAMA BARKER DEBUTED ON "MEET THE BARKERS"</strong></p><p class=dh>Alabama's first time on TV was as an infant. She featured in her family's reality show "Meet The Barkers" during the Christmas episode in 2005.</p><p class=dh>The MTV show produced only two seasons, airing between 2005 to 2006. Other stars in the series included Atiana, Landon as a toddler, his parents, and later, Alabama.</p><p class=dh>Travis's daughter has also appeared in other TV features, including "E! Live From The Red Carpet," "Kids React," and "The Kardashians."</p><p class=dh>The young <a class="me a" href=#>Barker</a> is also a singer. In 2017, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popbuzz.com/celeb/alabama-barker/>released</a> her debut single titled "Our House." This was a song that her dad and two other adults helped her compose.</p><p class=dh>Although Alabama is doing less music and more influencing today, she is a wiz at the game! At 16, she has an ambassadorship deal and a pool of fans reaching 1.4 million on Instagram and 2.5 million on TikTok. That's not all; her content on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.tiktok.com/@alabamabarker?refer=embed">TikTok</a> has received more than seventy million likes!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwanBmbXqpu9ZmpqWcXZ7Abq3LmpmapZFir6K%2Byp6pZ6Ckork%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./katie-holmes-tom-cruise-wedding-guest-confession-with-baby-daughter-suri.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's wedding guest confession with daughter Suri, 7 months">&larr;
