The toddler who lost her dad before she clocked two has blossomed into a beautiful young woman dedicated to making a name for herself.</p><p class=dh>Navigating through childhood and adulthood can be daunting. The quest to find one's self while establishing a path for one's life often takes its toll.</p><p class=dh>But this is perhaps more daunting for children who have to grow in the eye of the public. With a famous parent or being a child star, it is no wonder these adults try to find some privacy in their life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/8633da779fe00c609829f003900031cd.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>American singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain (1967 - 1994), performs with his group Nirvana at a taping of the television program 'MTV Unplugged,' New York, New York, Novemeber 18, 1993 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Kurt Cobain <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/05/entertainment/kurt-cobain-death-25-years-trnd/index.html>was a legendary singer</a> known for his time with the band "Nirvana." Dubbed as the voice of Generation X, the pressure soon got to him, and he committed suicide with a gunshot to his head.</p><p class=dh>However, before his passing, he had a beautiful daughter named <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/personality/frances-bean-cobain>Frances Bean Cobain</a>. Born to Courtney Love and <a class="me a" href=#>Kurt Cobain</a>, Frances is the only child the singer had before he passed on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d15b59856abd2eaa437b3111a4410794.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Courtney Love, Frances Bean Cobain, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana September 02, 1993 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FRANCES' LIFE AFTER DAD'S DEATH</strong></p><p class=dh>Growing up without a father figure can take its toll on the life of a child. Speaking on her life without her dad, Frances <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/frances-bean-cobain-on-life-after-kurts-death-an-exclusive-qa-186561/>revealed that while she somewhat </a>understands why he killed himself, she would have loved to have him around just to know him better.</p><p class=dh>Frances was barely two years old when her father Kurt Cobain committed suicide. It was not until she was five that her mother Courtney Love <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/07/kurt-cobains-daughter-frances-bean-talks-guilt-inheriting-fortune/2806822002/>told her about the suicide</a>, and this was after Courtney had spent a year in therapy.</p><p class=dh>With a mother who was an addict, Frances was partly raised by her paternal grandmother, who ensured that she lived life as healthy as possible. Her mother <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/courtney-love-frances-bean-cobain-out-of-spotlight-normal-childhood/>also attested that she tried</a> to ensure that Frances grew up with reasonable conditions for a child born into fame.</p><p class=dh>Although she never got to meet her father, the news, his songs, and talks about him were enough to give her the information that she needed to know about him although not in the manner that she would have preferred.</p><p class=dh>Recalling how people often compare her to her father, Frances<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/frances-bean-cobain-on-life-after-kurts-death-an-exclusive-qa-186561/> remembered a time when</a> the members of Nirvana came visiting and could not stop staring at her like they had seen a ghost because of her uncanny resemblance to Kurt.</p><p class=dh>With both parents in the limelight, Frances got exposed to fame at a young age but has since created her own path to live her life on her own terms.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=dh>Frances and Courtney Love <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/14/courtney.love.custody/index.html>did not have the best </a>mother-daughter relationship while she was growing up. Courtney, who was hooked on drugs even during her pregnancy with Frances, soon had to deal with constant custody battles right from the time she was pregnant.</p><p class=dh>Word had gotten out that she and Kurt were using drugs while she was pregnant, and social services<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/personality/frances-bean-cobain> had come to take the </a>child away from such a harmful setting.</p><p class=dh>While the case dragged on for a while, the couple was able to retain the custody of their child by promising to clean up their acts.</p><p class=dh>Although this worked for a few years, soon Courtney relapsed and was back to taking drugs. During this period, Wendy Cobain and some nannies were in charge of taking care of Frances.</p><p class=dh>As time progressed, the two tried to work on their relationship, but at some point, Frances filed for a restraining order against Courtney, although the reason was not revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f67682e72154072952befa14d5ade52f.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Kurt Cobain of Nirvana (right) with wife Courtney Love and daughter Frances Bean Cobain at the Universal Ampitheater in Universal City, California on September 02, 1993 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THOUGHTS ON FRANCES' LATE FATHER'S WORKS</strong></p><p class=dh>Many people regard Kurt as a legendary singer who revolutionized the Rock and Roll genre, but for Frances, this style of music is not for her.</p><p class=dh>While she admires the works of her father, especially his songwriting abilities, she revealed that she preferred other types of artists.

While it was a tough period for her, it was also a learning curve.</p><p class=dh>Talented and dynamic, one of Frances' dreams is to have a comic cookbook that is relatable to people.
