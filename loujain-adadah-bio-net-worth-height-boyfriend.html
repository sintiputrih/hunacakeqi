Juffali Brothers — one of the largest companies in Saudi Arabia for telecommunications, infrastructure, and insurance.</span></p><p><span>After Walid passed away, Loujain grieved for years. Given that she was fairly young and just a new mother, she cried every night realizing that their dream would never come true. But now, instead of tears, she smiles when she thinks of him. “Me and my daughters’ loss left a hole in our hearts and I know it will never go away, we never truly get over a loss but we move forward and evolve from it,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>As for their kids, the duo shares two, Talia and Lana, who turned 8 and 6 on October 30, and May 28, 2022, respectively.</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Dubai Bling</span></i><span> star still has pictures of her first husband on her IG.</span></p><p><span>But though Walid was Loujain’s first spouse, she wasn’t his first, nor his second! Walid was married three times. Firstly, to Basma al-Sulaiman, with whom he bears three children. Secondly, to the American model, Christina Estrada, in Dubai in 2001, with whom he had a daughter. And finally, he married Loujain in 2012 in a remarkable ceremony in Venice reported to have cost £10 million</span></p><p><span>It was also said that Loujain’s wedding sparked a divorce from her husband’s ex-wife Christina. Reportedly, from the £200 million divorce battle, Christina was awarded the biggest divorce settlement in English history of £75 million.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Loujain Adadah?</b></h3><p><span>Loujain Adadah was 34 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>Dubai Bling</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She was one of the youngest cast that season.</span></p><h3><b>Loujain Adadah Height And Weight</b></h3><p><span>Loujain Adadah stands tall at a height of under 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) and weighs below 56 kg (123 lbs).</span></p><p><span>According to the star, although she got a lot of modeling offers for beauty and fashion ads, she never was called for runways, as she wasn’t tall enough.</span></p><p><span>Mentioning her distinct features, Loujain has blue eyes, a triangular face, and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>Loujain Adadah Before</b></h3><p><span>Loujain Adadah has always been a beauty queen.
