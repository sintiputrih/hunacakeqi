Her film debut in <i>Blume in Love</i> early 1973 had Neil Simon smitten and he cast her in his Broadway play <i>The Good <a href=#>Doctor</a></i>. Shortly afterwards, Mason and Simon, a widower, fell in love and got married. That same year, Mason co-starred opposite James Caan in the 20th Century Fox film <i>Cinderella Liberty</i>, which netted her an Oscar nomination for Best <a href=#>Actress</a>.
