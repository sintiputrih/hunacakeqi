I used to love me some Curtis (before they completely changed his character), so I hate that she is very likely keeping a now adult child away from him for all of these years. And, really, she should know better than to tell Trina who she can and cannot be friends with. Noone, certaily no teenager is going to let their parents decide who their friends are. My parents tried that when I was a teenage. I kept the friends. They didn’t like it. I didn’t care much that they didn’t like it.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><p>The hairdo that I liked was pulled back behind her head. Now she has one that is long and straight. It looks like a bad wig.I would prefer the coils to this. Why not something shorter and wavy.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>PJS</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>January 21, 2023, 11:23pm <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p>I liked her curly hairdo, even if people called it a Poodle do.

It looked great.</p><p><span class=post-likes>8 Likes</span></p><p>When I first saw her new hairdo, I thought she had just come out of the shower and her hair was still wet, especially since she had a robe on.

Not a wrinkle or bag on her face. Wow!</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>RobynH</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>January 22, 2023, 5:32pm <span itemprop=position>9</span></span><p>I don’t. I like her natural curly hair. Do I wish she’d do more with her natural curly hair? Yes! With it being straight, and beautifully jet black, with her very very fair complexion, it just makes her head look big. I mean she is so petite and I just think the curls balanced her out better.</p><p>Oh my gosh! Before the powers that be blocked me because they can’t read between the lines, this is not a character/actor bash. I think the woman that plays Portia is beautiful. I think her body is beautiful! I think her complexion is beautiful! I think her natural curly jet black hair is beautiful! That’s all I’m saying!</p><p><span class=post-likes>8 Likes</span></p><p>She’s beautiful no matter how she wears her hair, but I love her natural curls the most. I think it would take lots of work to have to iron out her hair every day, and I wouldn’t think that a surgeon or doctor would have time to primp and prepare before going off to work, especially when there is an emergency. It could be a fun thing to do for a party or while on vacation, but I wouldn’t think the character would have time to keep up with it.</p><p>Plus, her curls make her look fun and playful, which I think is in line with her delightful personality.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>Prefer Portia’s naturally curly hair. Straight is alright for change of pace, but keep it natural.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Not a fan of the straight hairdo.</p><p>Don’t mind the curly, but it could have been switched up now and then. It just was always done the same way for so long.</p><p>My favorite was maybe last week or something, she had her hair tied up, and loose tendrils framing her face. It looked so pretty.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I like tied up with the tendrils also. So pretty. That straight look is not becoming.

She’s a beautiful woman, though.

Please don’t misunderstand - - I love it when anyone tries out a new do.
