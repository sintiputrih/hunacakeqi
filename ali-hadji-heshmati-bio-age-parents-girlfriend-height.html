Based on the book series of the same name, it introduced to viewers the cast of Ruby Stokes, <a href=#>Cameron Chapman</a>, Ali Hadji-Heshmativ, and more.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the rest of the writing, we shall discuss Ali Hadji-Heshmati, her age, parents, girlfriend, height, and more.</p><h3><strong>Ali Hadji-Heshmati On Lockwood & Co</strong></h3><p>Lockwood & Co is a story set in London, where the most gifted teenage ghost hunters trio from Jonathan Stroud’s renowned book series reside. Ali’s character who is one of them ventures nightly into perilous combat with deadly spirits.</p><p>In the eight-part series, Ali plays George Karim who uses his research powers to destroy ghosts. So, all through the exuberant series, which has been compared to Doctor Who, George and his mates encounter many terrifying ghosts. So, in his recent-times interview, Ali also talked about being “genuinely terrified” while filming the chilling scenes. “I wasn’t even acting I was genuinely terrified”, he told Metro.co.uk.</p><p>About his character, Ali also once gushed that George Karim is much cooler than him.</p><p>Lockwood & Co in the series is a start-up agency run by George and Anthony Lockwood in a big house in central London, where a very talented, newly arrived girl from up north called Lucy also joins. They find themselves constantly trying to keep their agency running while fighting for their lives.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Ali Hadji-Heshmati Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Ali Hadji-Heshmati reportedly had close to<span> $150K net worth as of January 2023.</span></p><p>Ali always loved acting but initially, he wanted to be an astronaut. But, things changed when at 12 he “pathetically” auditioned for a school play because this girl he fancied said to do it with her. He ended up getting a main part, loved it so much that, and since then has wanted to act as much as possible.</p><p>At the time of this writing, Ali was also set to star in the upcoming season of Bad Education. When asked what&nbsp;was it like filming with Jack Whitehall, he said he just remembers laughing on set with Layton, Charlie, and Class K and also doing many crazy scenes.</p><p>Ali, who started out on Holby City (Series 22 and 23), while doing all of these new roles was also a part-time student at the University of Oxford studying English Literature, as of early 2023. He dropped out of full-time studies when he got offered Lockwood & Co.</p><p>About his dream role, Ali said it is not one role in particular but rather to have the fortune of playing a range of characters and of course of working on an A24 project. He also gushed that he would love to work with the directors like Ana Lily Amirpour, Greta Gerwig, and Noah Baumbach, among others.</p><p>Ali also previously appeared as Jahid in Christopher Smith-directed and Eleventh Hour Films/Amazon Studios produced Alex Rider.</p><p>At this point in his career, he was represented by Daphne Waring/Associate: Richard Carey.</p><h3><strong>Ali Hadji-Heshmati Age</strong></h3><p>Ali Hadji-Heshmati was born in 1999.

Not even his social media could tell us about his present or past love affairs. There was simply no evidence of a girlfriend on his socials.</p><p>Ali apparently talked a lot about himself, from missing reading and discussing books as he used to now that he is busy with his career and looking forward to passing his driving test in 2023. But, he chose not to bring up the girlfriend-related topic in his very recent interview with COUNTRY & TOWN HOUSE. Or maybe they just did not bring that topic up during the one-on-one. At the time, Ali also quickly fired at them that he was currently reading&nbsp;Making Movies by Sidney Lumet and that the last thing he watched was Le Grand Amour – Pierre Étaix. Also, he said his favorite films of all time are&nbsp;Incredibles, Le Quatre Cent Coers, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</p><h3><strong>Ali Hadji-Heshmati Parents</strong></h3><p>Ali Hadji-Heshmati’s parents’ details were unavailable as of now.
