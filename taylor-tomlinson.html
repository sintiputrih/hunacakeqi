Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Taylor Tomlinson for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Taylor Tomlinson agent on your behalf if your funding is in place.

If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired.
