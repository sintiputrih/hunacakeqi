Unfortunately, Cavill’s casual misogyny has ultimately cost him the iconic roles that shaped his career.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He was allegedly in a showmance with Kaley Cuoco</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Henry-Cavill-Kaley-Cuoco.jpg><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Cavill was promoting&nbsp;Man of Steel,&nbsp;which premiered on June 14, 2013, when he started dating actor <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaley Cuoco</a></strong> that July. During their fleeting ten-day romance, the pair managed to squeeze in several paparazzi strolls before their relationship fizzled out as abruptly as it began.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>At the time, Cuoco was the second highest-paid television actress in Hollywood, and to some, the timing and nature of Cavill’s fling with Cuoco seemed suspicious. Many wondered who leaked the news of their budding romance to the news media. There were whispers that their relationship was a tawdry publicity stunt invented by their publicists.</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>Cavill soon resumed his relationship with his girlfriend, Gina Carano, whom he started dating in September 2012.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He dated a big game hunter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rs_600x600-141211180200-600.HENRY-CAVILL-MARISA.jpg><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>In 2014, Cavill ended his relationship with Carano and started dating Marisa Gonzalo, a then 21-year-old from Detroit, Michigan, who was a big game hunter in her spare time. Fans of the&nbsp;Mission Impossible&nbsp;star were baffled to learn that the self-described animal lover was dating someone who killed animals for sport.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>He was beloved for raising money to support environmental causes. The star encouraged fans to sponsor mountain gorillas and other endangered species.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>Cavill aficionados were stunned when the photos Gonzalo had proudly posted of her kills on social media circulated in the press. Many felt that it was hypocritical of Cavill to claim to love animals on one hand while dating someone who killed animals as a hobby.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>His relationship with Gonzalo eventually collapsed amidst scandalous rumors that she was leaking stories to the press for profit and clout.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He got aroused on the set of The Tudors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hs1.jpg><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>In 2015, Cavill told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Men’s Fitness</a>&nbsp;that he got aroused while shooting an intimate scene with a colleague for&nbsp;The Tudors. He admitted that he had not prepared properly before the shoot.</p><p>“I hadn’t rearranged my—stuff into a harmless position. She’s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.”</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>However, Cavill said that the blushing event was a one-time thing. He explained that he found it challenging to expose his body on set in front of members of the cast and crew. He said the experience was awkward and distasteful. Cavill gave a dismal description of shooting sex scenes:</p><p>“The actual physicality is very uncomfortable. All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone, and nothing is going in.”</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>Some might say that his comments underscore the importance of having intimacy coordinators on TV and film sets to monitor the choreography for the scene and safeguard the actors.</p><h2 id=h-he-dated-a-teenager-when-he-was-in-his-30s data-injectable=false>He dated a teenager when he was in his 30s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Getty-Images-Henry-Cavill.jpg><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>In October 2015, 32-year-old <a href=#>Cavill fell for a 19-year-old Bristol University student</a> at Mahiki nightclub in London. Her name was Tara King, and Cavill went public with their relationship shortly after it began.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>The&nbsp;Enola Holmes&nbsp;star happily attended red-carpet events with the teenager on his arm. When <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elle</a> asked him about their age gap, Cavill remarked:</p><p>“People say age is just a number. It’s actually a real and true sign of someone’s maturity. But in this case, she’s fantastic.”</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false>He also revealed that when he was 19, he was in a relationship with a 32-year-old.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Cavill had high praise for King, who he described as protective, caring, and accepting. However, their romance ended in May 2016. Sources say the pair split because they were looking for different things, but remained friends.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He claims age-appropriate relationships aren’t easy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Getty-Images-Henry-Cavill-Millie-Bobby-Brown.jpg><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Cavill claimed he dated younger women for practical reasons, explaining the demands of his career made it difficult to date someone with an established life of their own. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Playboy</a> that it was challenging to date a public figure for women his age with their own careers. He explained that young women who had not established their careers were more amendable to his lifestyle:</p><p>“It’s tough for anyone to be in a relationship with someone like me. It’s a tough lifestyle. If I want someone who’s a professional they’ve got their own s**t going on. So unless I meet someone who’s very, very young who hasn’t yet started trying a career like that, you can then go, ‘Okay, I’m going to travel with you and do some stuff, maybe I’ll write or whatever; I’ll entertain myself or build my own kind of traveling career.'”</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Cavill said he would like to have a relationship with an age-appropriate partner who had built an established life. He revealed that he’s come to understand that unequal relationships aren’t wholesome.</p><p>I’m looking for someone who’s my own age and will have a career. If they haven’t, then maybe I should be worried. It’s easier said than done.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Once again, Cavill’s comments stirred up controversy and his interview with&nbsp;Playboy&nbsp;was scrubbed from the internet to protect his image.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>Perhaps someday, Cavill will realize that many men in his career field have accomplished the daunting feat of building an equal relationship with a romantic partner and learning from their example.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Controversial remarks about the #MeToo movement</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Henry Cavill (@henrycavill)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>In 2018, Cavill engineered a self-made disaster with his astonishingly insensitive remarks about how the #MeToo movement inconvenienced his love life. He appeared to be oblivious to the harm of sexual violence on people who experienced it and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed disdain</a> for changing social and cultural norms surrounding sexual harassment and consent.</p><p>“It’s very difficult to do that if there are certain rules in place. Because then it’s like: ‘Well, I&nbsp;don’t want to go up and talk to her, because I’m going to be called a rapist or something. So you’re like, ‘Forget it, I’m going to call an ex-girlfriend instead, and then just go back to a relationship, which never really worked.’ But it’s way safer than casting myself into the fires of hell, because I’m someone in the public eye, and if I go and flirt with someone, then who knows what’s going to happen?”</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>People found Cavill’s views problematic for several reasons. His remarks perpetuated harmful myths about sexual harassment and consent. He also expressed a misguided belief that women are to be feared or conquered as opposed to accepting women as people with a right to set boundaries around their sexuality. Finally, his comment seemed to suggest that the protection of women from sexual harassment complicates the lives of men.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Cavill published an apology in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>,&nbsp;claiming he has only the utmost respect for women and blaming the editors at&nbsp;GQ Australia&nbsp;for how his obtuse views found their way into print.</p><p>“Never would I intend to disrespect in any way, shape, or form. This experience has taught me a valuable lesson as to the context and the nuance of editorial liberties.”</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>As flimsy as his redress was, his fans gave him a pass and went back to swooning over his good looks.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Most of the controversies surrounding Henry Cavill seem related to his cavalier attitude toward women and several tone-deaf remarks about the #MeToo movement. Fortunately for the British star, his fanbase remains unswayed by the star’s sexist shenanigans and he’s currently gearing up for<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Amazon Prime Video’s Warhammer adaptation</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1pr7ErGStoJViwbDEyJxkm52YlsOqu9Fmn56moq56pK3VoqOlZZiWwG6x16Ggm6GkmrFusNSroKefXZ22tHnCmqmenaJk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kwebbelkop.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Kwebbelkop>&larr;
