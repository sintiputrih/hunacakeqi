SUSAN KUCERA photos</p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic began impeding Maui musicians’ ability to perform live for audiences, Eric Gilliom was offered an alternative creative opportunity — scoring award-winning documentary filmmaker Susan Kucera’s latest film, <span class=quotations>“Hot Money.”</span></p><p>It was both a dream gig and one of the most challenging projects of Gilliom’s career.</p><p>While he has composed many songs and acted in movies like the Barefoot Natives’ <span class=quotations>“Get a Job,”</span> with Willie K, he had never created an entire soundtrack before.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I was excited,”</span> Gilliom recalled of Kucera’s offer. <span class=quotations>“The timing was amazing. It was literally when everything was ‘do not leave your house.’ Susan gave me a lot of space. She would say, ‘I want a Latin feel here or hip-hop feel on this thing.’ “</span></p><p>Gilliom ended up composing 52 music tracks across a spectrum of genres.</p><img width=600 height=428 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2021/01/20062602/os-hot-money-bridges-and-clark-1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark (left) talks with actor and producer Jeff Bridges in Susan Kucera’s documentary “Hot Money.” Bridges was also the executive producer.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s almost a two-hour documentary, and there’s music through the entire film,”</span> he explained. <span class=quotations>“Some tracks were amazingly difficult, very complex flamenco guitar parts and classical pieces like Mozart.”</span></p><p>Spending about four months on the project, he had some help from Kauai-based producer Michael Ruff, who has worked with artists such as India Arie, Bonnie Raitt and Stevie Nicks.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It was just Michael and I, and about three quarters of the soundtrack I did by myself,”</span> said Gilliom.</p><p>The <span class=quotations>“Hot Money”</span> director is full of praise for Gilliom’s contribution to her film, which will be screened today at the virtual <span class=quotations>“Clean Energy for America Inaugural Ball”</span> for President Joe Biden.</p><p><span class=quotations>“The music he came up with is truly amazing,”</span> Kucera enthused. <span class=quotations>“It was such a nice collaborative experience. He worked really hard.”</span></p><img width=600 height=737 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2021/01/20062604/os-hot-money-eric-gilliom-1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>ERIC GILLIOM – Scored documentary</p><p>Built around a discussion between former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark and his son, Army veteran and environmental activist Wesley Clark Jr., <span class=quotations>“Hot Money”</span> explores how climate change is impacting the global financial system.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Things are going to break down,”</span> Wesley Clark Jr. says in the film. <span class=quotations>“Do you think my kids are going to go, ‘I always wanted my kids to grow up in “</span>Mad Max<span class=quotations>” and eating lizards off the road?’ “</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“It only takes small disruptions and you would see catastrophe,”</span> adds General Clark. <span class=quotations>“We’re heading over a cliff.”</span></p><p>A part-time Kula resident who attended school on Oahu, Kucera was initially inspired to create her new film after talking with General Clark.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We were both asked to speak at a conference in Las Vegas,”</span> she explained. <span class=quotations>“I sat with him at dinner and he said, ‘Susan, you really need to do a film on the financial side of everything.’ “</span></p><img width=600 height=778 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2021/01/20062608/os-hot-money-general-and-wes-jr-b.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>GEN. WESLEY CLARK – Inspired film’s creation</p><p>She describes her new film as “a nuts-and-bolts view of how the machinery of our money system contributes and reacts to climate change.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Many people lack context interpreting the world and this documentary delivers it,”</span> Kucera said. <span class=quotations>“Climate change is something that’s coming in the future; our financial implosion could come much sooner. The last 30 minutes of the film talks about the strategies and basic steps we can all take to avoid calamity.”</span></p><p>In examining complex economic systems, the film reveals how it now takes three times as much debt to make the same amount of gross domestic product as it did in 1970, how home mortgages end up becoming part of risky hedge funds and derivatives providing high rates of short-term return, and the global shadow banking system <span class=quotations>“that has hardly any rules,”</span> economist Servaas Storm explains in the film. <span class=quotations>“It’s almost the Wild West of the financial sector.”</span></p><p>Looking at the big picture, General Clark notes, <span class=quotations>“The system is so complicated that accountability is lost.”</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“We started to look at the financial system to see how it works and how it’s not working, as it’s leaving us very vulnerable,”</span> said Kucera. <span class=quotations>“It’s almost like getting a Ph.D. in economics watching it, but it’s entertaining. It’s really eye-opening, and you can see the threads of how we need to change our system at every level.”</span></p><p>In 2018, Kucera released the remarkable documentary, <span class=quotations>“Living in the Future’s Past,”</span> which won the United Nations gold medal for Outstanding Achievement in International Communications.</p><p>Narrated and produced by Jeff Bridges, <span class=quotations>“Living in the Future’s Past,”</span> traced human evolutionary history with psychological and sociological insights, while providing a unique perspective on the concept of energy. Mapping the interconnectedness of all things, and exploring how collectively and individually people could more consciously face the future, it featured stunning nature cinematography.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It has evolutionary biology and how our brains function, and how we’re collective entities,”</span> Kucera noted. <span class=quotations>“I learned a lot and I was glad I got to use a lot of my imagery because I film and document all the time.”</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“Living in the Future’s Past”</span> compiled so much important information it almost requires repeated viewing.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s been so popular with universities and schools,”</span> she said. <span class=quotations>“We did a free 50-page study guide for schools.”</span></p><p>Kucera began filmmaking at the age of 9 while helping her dad, a glaciologist and professor, make science films for Britannica. She has been exploring the planet’s future since her critically acclaimed 2014 film <span class=quotations>“Breath of Life,”</span> which was partially shot in Hawaii, featuring canoe paddler and environmentalist Wayne <span class=quotations>“Vene”</span> Chun. Premiered at the Maui Film Festival, it won the audience award.</p><p>In February, she will begin shooting a new documentary in the islands with a Hawaii theme.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Jeff (Bridges) suggested I make a trailer so we can get more financing,”</span> she said. <span class=quotations>“Eric (Gilliom) will help as well. It’s 100 percent Hawaii orientated.”</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“Hot Money”</span> will be available on streaming and cable platforms worldwide Thursday, including: iTunes, Amazon, Hoopla, FandangoNow, GooglePlay, Vudu, Vimeo and across hundreds of cable providers, including Comcast, Spectrum, Charter, Cox, Dish, DirecTV and more. DVD retailers will include Amazon and all other major online retailers.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX6QaGdqZ5WntqR5xqKjpaGfo3q0r86rnKxlm6q5onnFoqOmpZGgsrO%2FjJ2mnK2dmru1rdGyZKimXZi5qrnArZxmm5iWu6ixjJymrKxf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brad-thor-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brad Thor Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
