She leaked chats of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Offset begging her for sex </a>when the issue about him not paying for child support arose and Cardi B got involved asking for receipts of Offset’s alleged beg for sex. Shya took to her Instagram to rant about Offset and Cardi B and actually shared the receipts she was asked to share.</p><p>When Cardi B eventually announced her divorce from her husband Offset, it seemed like Shya and Offset rekindled their romance again as both of them were pictured spending a lot of time together, and even Offset shared photos of him and Shya with his daughter together.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kxKm7jKKqZquYrq5uuMCmpq6qXWZ9brLAnKusZZKkwrV5x56pZquTlrulrctmrqKsmGKwor7DomSbq12dwrSuwKebaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alexa-chung-selects-her-father-as-a-date-for-various-occasions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexa Chung Selects Her Father as a Date for Various Occasions">&larr;
