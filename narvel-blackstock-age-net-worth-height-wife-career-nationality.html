Similarly, he is Linda Davis and Kelly Clarkson’s music manager.</p><p>Furthermore, Narvel and Reba McEntire co-founded Starstruck Entertainment. This record label later managed Reba McEntire’s country music career. The end of his second marriage, on the other hand, became a hot topic for tabloids after he and Reba announced in August 2015 that they had separated months before.</p><p>Similarly, Narvel is well-known for his work on Reba: Video Gold II (2006), Malibu Country (2012), and Forever Love (2013).

On June 3, 1989, they married in a private ceremony on a boat in Lake Tahoe.</p><p>Both of them were going through divorces when they met, and this was what brought them together.
