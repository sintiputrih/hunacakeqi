It has experienced ups and downs, its heyday and its downs, but despite all of that, it is still relevant today, largely because of its exceptional capacity to tell love tales and make the audience laugh along the way. Of course, not every moviegoer prefers rom-coms, but the vast majority of viewers have looked to them at least once for upbeat, optimistic, straightforward material.</p><p>It’s safe to assume that rom-coms are predictable and replete with cliches. In nearly every movie, the main characters repeatedly act out the same narrative in which love prevails in the end. Nevertheless, rom-com fans continue to enjoy each and every new film because each director and cast brings a fresh viewpoint to the genre, as well as because we enjoy seeing love tales that could very well be our own.</p><p><a href=#>Romantic comedies</a> have managed to include some of Hollywood’s and the world’s top stars, from actors to directors and filmmakers, despite not being the most well-liked film genre. Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Ashton Kutcher, and Julia Roberts are just a handful of the many actors who have acted in rom-coms through the years. And while the majority of these films are suitable for all viewers, there have been a few R-rated productions over the years with topics that are only appropriate for adult audiences. Here are the leading ten.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Bridget Jones’s Diary</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Friends with Benefits</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Love Actually</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Palm Springs</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Pretty Woman</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Punch-Drunk Love</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> There’s Something About Mary</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> When Harry Met Sally…</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Bridget_Jones8217s_Diary>Bridget Jones’s Diary<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bridget-Joness-Diary.jpg alt="romantic comedies rated r 2020,best romantic comedies rated r,romantic comedies rated r on netflix,romantic comedies rated r hollywood,romantic comedies rated r imdb,rated r movies,r rated comedies 2022,r rated romance movies imdb,r rated rom-coms on netflix,best r-rated romance movies on netflix,romance r rated movie 2022,rated 18 romantic comedy movies,romantic comedies rated r,rated r romantic comedies on netflix,r rated romantic comedy movies,romantic comedy rated pg,rotten tomatoes highest rated romantic comedies,r rated romantic comedies,romantic comedy highest rated,romantic comedies rated g" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Renée Zellweger received widespread recognition and her first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her major role in the romantic comedy Bridget Jones’s Diary. The same-named novel by Helen Fielding, who also contributed to the writing for the movie along with Richard Curtis and Andrew Davis, served as the inspiration for this Sharon Maguire production. In Bridget Jones’s Diary, Bridget, a 30-year-old woman with a poor love life, decides to make a significant change in her life in 1999 in order to feel better about herself and find a spouse. She documents this decision in a diary. Soon, two men—one who looks to be the ideal partner and the other who, although appearing to be anything but ideal, yet appeals to her more than she would like to admit—start competing for her love.</p><p>Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Colin Firth, and Renee Zellweger all appear in this production with Zellweger. This romantic comedy was followed by two sequels, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason and Bridget Jones’ Baby, which were equally successful at the box office.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u9d77702e7e64a080ecbbc76e9c984197><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>R-Rated Movies on Hulu: A Diverse Collection</span></a><h3><span id=Forgetting_Sarah_Marshall>Forgetting Sarah Marshall<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Forgetting-Sarah-Marshall.jpg alt="romantic comedies rated r 2020,best romantic comedies rated r,romantic comedies rated r on netflix,romantic comedies rated r hollywood,romantic comedies rated r imdb,rated r movies,r rated comedies 2022,r rated romance movies imdb,r rated rom-coms on netflix,best r-rated romance movies on netflix,romance r rated movie 2022,rated 18 romantic comedy movies,romantic comedies rated r,rated r romantic comedies on netflix,r rated romantic comedy movies,romantic comedy rated pg,rotten tomatoes highest rated romantic comedies,r rated romantic comedies,romantic comedy highest rated,romantic comedies rated g" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Over the years, Jason Segel and Judd Apatow have frequently worked together on a variety of projects. Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the movie that gave Segel his first leading role and launched his career, is undoubtedly one of their most well-liked works. In addition to acting in this romantic comedy, Jason wrote the script, Apatow handled production, and Nicholas Stoller handled the directing.</p><p>Forgetting Peter, a composer who appears to be leading a happy life, has been dating Sarah, a rising TV personality, for many years. Sarah Marshall watches them. But when she abruptly ends the relationship, Peter falls into a hole from which he struggles mightily to emerge. He travels to Hawaii to relax in an effort to move on with his life, unaware that his ex-girlfriend and her new partner have the same vacation plans and will also be staying at the same resort. In this romantic comedy, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, and Russell Brand appear alongside Segel.</p><h3><span id=Friends_with_Benefits>Friends with Benefits</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Friends-with-Benefits.jpg alt="romantic comedies rated r 2020,best romantic comedies rated r,romantic comedies rated r on netflix,romantic comedies rated r hollywood,romantic comedies rated r imdb,rated r movies,r rated comedies 2022,r rated romance movies imdb,r rated rom-coms on netflix,best r-rated romance movies on netflix,romance r rated movie 2022,rated 18 romantic comedy movies,romantic comedies rated r,rated r romantic comedies on netflix,r rated romantic comedy movies,romantic comedy rated pg,rotten tomatoes highest rated romantic comedies,r rated romantic comedies,romantic comedy highest rated,romantic comedies rated g" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>In Will Gluck’s romantic comedy <a href=#>Friends with Benefits</a> from 2011, Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake shared the screen with great chemistry.

The two become friends after meeting through a job offer, and after learning about their shared interests, they decide to start a <a href=#>casual sex</a> relationship with no feelings at all. They both deny it, but this strategy does not go as planned as they quickly realise they are falling in love with one another.</p><p>Friends with Benefits received positive reviews, a few nominations for awards, and it became a global box office success.

It has a fantastic ensemble cast that includes stars like Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, and Liam Neeson, among many more.</p><p>Like many previous rom-coms, Love Actually rapidly became a box office success and thoroughly enchanted audiences, but not so much critics.

Sally believes they can, despite Harry’s less upbeat outlook on things. Fortunately, the movie examines their sporadic relationship across several years, giving the spectator the chance to form their own opinions about that mystery.</p><p>Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, two actresses who received a lot of praise for their performances in When Harry Met Sally, are joined by Carrie Fisher, Bruno Kirby, Steven Ford, and Lisa Jane Persky.
