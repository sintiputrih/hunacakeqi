The group, dubbed The Bling Ring, was a team of five teenagers and two adults including Rachel Lee, Diana Tamayo, Courtney Ames, Nick Prugo, Alexis Neiers, Johnny Ajar, and Roy Lopez. Jr. The celebrity-obsessed teenagers started burglarizing the homes of their onscreen models in 2008 and carried on with the act until CCTV footage from one of the victim’s homes led to their arrest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="Where Are The Stars Of GLOW Now?">Where Are The Stars Of GLOW Now?</a></span></p><p>Recently, <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>released a docuseries titled The Real Bling Ring: Hollywood Heist to provide a firsthand account of the 2008/2009 burglaries.

Her petite stature made it easy for her to go through doggie doors to gain access for the team. Like every other bling ring member, Tamayo was arrested, except she faced the possibility of deportation for being an undocumented immigrant.</p><p>Ultimately, she was sentenced to three years on probation with two months of community service.
