With a fastball that can reach over 100 mph, he has been a force to be reckoned with since his debut in 2010. Over the course of his career, he has been named to six All-Star teams and won the World Series with the Chicago Cubs in 2016. Despite his impressive accomplishments, there has been some debate over whether or not he should be inducted into the MLB Hall of Fame. In this article, we will explore the case for Chapman's induction.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the main arguments for Chapman's induction is his dominance on the mound. Over the course of his career, he has consistently been one of the most effective relief pitchers in the league. He has a career ERA of 2.24, which is well below the league average. In addition, he has struck out 14.4 batters per nine innings, which is the highest rate in MLB history among pitchers with at least 500 innings pitched.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Chapman has also been a key player in several important games throughout his career. In the 2016 World Series, he played a pivotal role in helping the Chicago Cubs win their first championship in over 100 years. He recorded the final out of the decisive Game 7, striking out the Cleveland Indians' Michael Martinez with a 101 mph fastball.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another argument in favor of Chapman's induction is his impact on the game. He has been a trendsetter in terms of the way relief pitchers are used in baseball. Prior to his arrival, it was uncommon for a relief pitcher to be used for more than one inning at a time. However, Chapman has frequently been used for multiple innings, and has even been used as a closer for more than one inning in important games.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Chapman's impact on the game can also be seen in the way other pitchers have emulated his style. Many young pitchers have tried to replicate his fastball, and some have even tried to throw harder than him. In addition, the way Chapman has been used has influenced other teams to experiment with their bullpen usage.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite his on-field accomplishments, Chapman has also had some off-the-field issues that have caused some to question whether or not he should be inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was suspended for 30 games for violating the league's domestic violence policy. He was accused of choking his girlfriend and firing a gun in his garage. While he was not charged with a crime, the incident was still a cause for concern.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Aroldis Chapman has a strong case for induction into the MLB Hall of Fame. He has been one of the most dominant relief pitchers in recent memory, with a fastball that ranks among the best in MLB history. In addition, his impact on the game has been significant, as he has been a trendsetter in terms of bullpen usage. However, his off-the-field issues are certainly cause for concern, and may be a factor in the voting process. Ultimately, it will be up to the voters to decide whether or not Chapman has done enough to earn a spot in the Hall of Fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6sn6itnJl6or7OpZuiq12YtaK8zJqlZpqVYravsNScq56cXZ67tbuMrZ%2BeZZ2hr260wKWjZqeWYrOiucRmnLGonKS%2FqrrGZquhnV2YrrSxjJ%2Bmq2WknbJussuapJ5lpJ2%2FsMPIp55mm5ykwKa%2B</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thomas-delauer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thomas DeLauer">&larr;
