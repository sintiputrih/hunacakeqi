Some sharks that live in shallow reef areas, etc have adapted to live up to 12 hours or so outside of water (should the reef dry up, etc.). However, most large shark species can only survive minutes outside of water. Very similar to us if we were without air. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Is the Long Island Sound safe to swim in?</h2>78% of Long Island Sound beaches earned an “A” or “B” grade.

The faster they swim, the more water is pushed through their gills. If they stop swimming, they stop receiving oxygen.
