Apparently, getting soda or really any beverage from a soda fountain machine isn't always the smartest idea. You see, one <a href=#>TikTok</a> creator took to the platform to explain what happened after she went into <a href=#>Arby's</a> to get water from the soda fountain.</p><p>What happened, exactly? Let's just say that the water changed in the worst way possible. Keep reading for all of the details. You might think twice before you get a fountain drink again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Woman says "spores" developed in the water after she left it in her car for a week.</h2><p>"If I ever try to drink from one of those machines that has the touch screens where you select your drink ever again, then somebody shoot me. I will never do it again," said a TikTok user named Brynn (<a href=# style=text-align:left rel="noopener noreferrer">@brynnnniethepooh</a>) in a video.</p><p>She explained that her car was recently having issues so she went into the fast food restaurant to get some water.

I don't know if it's from sitting in the heat, but I ain't never seen water do that so something ain't right," she said as she ended her video.</p><p>In her caption, she corrected herself to note that she had gotten the water from Wendy's and not Arby's.</p><p>Viewers had all sorts of things to say about Brynn's sus soda fountain water.</p><p>"My mom was the ONLY one who ever cleaned the soda nozzle where she worked and it was caked with mold when she started ... guys clean the nozzles," remarked one user.</p><p>Another, who claimed to work for Coca-Cola wrote, "Looks like syrup lines were mixed into the water lines. Water could have had sugar in it. Need a line replacement/flush/sanitize."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@brynnnniethepooh</a></figure><p>"A third user commented, "I get water from a natural spring on the side of the road and I've found bottles a year old in my car that were clear.
