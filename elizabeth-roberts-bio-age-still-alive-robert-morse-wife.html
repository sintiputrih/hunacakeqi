Robert had been in the industry since 1953 before he found fame as the star of both the 1961 original Broadway production and won a Tony Award for it. The late Broadway star is also known for the 1967 film adaptation of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying;&nbsp;for his role as Bertram Cooper in the critically acclaimed Mad Men&nbsp;series. For playing Truman Capote in the 1989 production of the one-man play Tru he won his second Tony and for playing Capote in an airing of the play for American Playhouse in 1992 they gave him a Primetime Emmy Award. And now that all of this is in the past, let us tell you about his wife Elizabeth Roberts he leaves behind in this world.</p><p style=text-align:left>Robert is survived by Elizabeth Roberts, his wife for a long-time.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Elizabeth Roberts, Robert Morse’s Wife</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Robert Morse breathed his last air at his home in Los Angeles, California, with likely his wife Elizabeth Roberts by his side.</p><p style=text-align:left>By the look of it, Elizabeth is not popular in her own right and is rather simply known as Robert Morse’s wife. She and Robert tied the knot sometime in 1989; were married for 33 years until the time of his passing.</p><p>It was Robert’s friend, Larry Karaszewski the screenwriter, and son Charlie, who had confirmed his death on Twitter and to CNN affiliate KABC.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Many Kids Did Elizabeth Roberts And Robert Morse Have?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Elizabeth Roberts and Robert Morse welcomed two children into their lives, daughter Allyn Elizabeth and son Charles Robert. Allyn Elizabeth Morse was born on 19 April 1991 in Los Angeles, California. She is an actress and writer, known for Tell Me About It, Wendy (2015), Scotch Moses (2014), and Heathers (2018).</p><p>Speaking of Charles, aka Charlie, he turned 25 years old in July 2021.</p><p style=text-align:left>Moreover, now deceased Robert also had brought in a couple of kids from his previous marriage.</p><p style=text-align:left>Before Elizabeth, the&nbsp;That’s Life actor was married to actress Carole D’Andrea. They were married in 1961 and had remained so for 20 years before divorcing in 1981.</p><p style=text-align:left>Born in 1937 in Pennsylvania, Robert’s now 75-year-old ex Carole starred in West Side Story (1961) and That’s Dancing! (1985). According to IMDb, they were her only acting credits, before she went on to teach acting and singing classes in Los Angeles.</p><p style=text-align:left>So, on Carole’s side, Robert is survived by his daughters Andrea, Hilary, and Robin Morse. All of them are now actresses.</p><p style=text-align:left>Robert, at this point, is also survived by a brother, Richard, and five grandchildren.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Elizabeth Roberts Still Alive?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Indeed! Elizabeth Roberts is still alive as of March 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Elizabeth Roberts Age</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Born sometime in June 1963, Elizabeth, with the full name Elizabeth Cosby Roberts, turned 58 years old in 2021.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Elizabeth Roberts Job</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>The New York Times cited Elizabeth as an elementary school teacher. And that was all known about her career as of this time. (Of course) her net worth was also a mystery.</p><p style=text-align:left>Her Newton, Massachusetts-born husband, on the other hand, had reportedly made a net worth of $5 million by 2015.</p><p>Robert was born on 18 May 1931 to May Silver, a pianist, and Charles Morse, who worked at a record store and managed a chain of movie theaters. So, he grew up attending several different schools until finding inspiration in a music teacher at Newton High School. Then, following graduation, he left home for New York City to fulfill his dream of becoming an actor. He joined his older brother Richard who, at the time, was already studying acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse.</p><p>So it began, his career, with an uncredited role in The Proud and Profane in 1956. Thereon, he was cast as Barnaby Tucker in the original Broadway production of Thornton Wilder’s The Matchmaker. This is what later on marked the launching of his career.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Where Is Elizabeth Roberts From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p style=text-align:left>Elizabeth Roberts is likely from&nbsp;Mineola, a village in and the county seat of Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Is Elizabeth Roberts On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p style=text-align:left>Elizabeth Roberts did not seem to be on Instagram or any other social media platforms.</p><p style=text-align:left>Her husband Robert, however, was on Twitter @<a href=#>robertalanmorse</a>.
