We try to figure out his cause of death, obituary and when and were his funeral will be held.</p><p>Larsen served for 28 years in the North Dakota State Army Guard. Those under him were in charge of the 112th Aviation Battalion.</p><p>When Doug Larsen wasn’t running for office, he worked as a real estate agent. He is in charge of Apex Builders, a company that builds and sells houses.</p><h2><strong>Doug Larsen Cause Of Death</strong></h2><p>Officials said Monday that a state senator from North Dakota, his wife, and their two young children died in a plane crash in Utah.</p><p>The Grand County Sheriff’s Office said in a news statement that State Sen. Doug Larsen was flying a plane with his wife Amy and two of their kids on Sunday evening in Grand County, Utah. The plane crashed.</p><p>Around 8:30 p.m., the sheriff’s office got a call about a single plane “taking off from the Canyonlands Regional Airport and then crashing into the ground.”</p><p>In easy words, the North Dakota Senate died in a terrible plane crash. Doug Larsen and his family were on board the plane that crashed in Utah.</p><p>The Senator passed away on Sunday, but a Senate leader revealed it on Monday.</p><p>Reports say the plane went down on Sunday night not long after taking off from Canyonlands Airfield, which is about 15 miles north of Moab.</p><p>The Grand County Sheriff’s Department wrote on Facebook about what happened to Senator Doug Larsen and his family in North Dakota.</p><p>“Senator Doug Larsen, his wife Amy, and their two young children died in a plane crash last evening in Utah,” Hogue wrote in his email. “They were going to Scottsdale to see family and then coming back home.” In Utah, they stopped to get more petrol.</p><p>Moab is a town of about 5,300 people that is based around tourism. It is close to Arches and Canyonlands National Parks.</p><h2><strong>Doug Larsen Obituary and Death&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>On Monday, the majority leader of the North Dakota Senate confirmed the deaths of a state senator, his wife, and their two young children, who were all aboard a tiny plane that crashed shortly after refueling in Utah.</p><p>Republican Senate Majority Leader David Hogue emailed his fellow senators on Monday to confirm Doug Larsen’s death, which was reported by The Associated Press.</p><p>The jet crashed shortly after taking off from Canyonlands Airfield, which is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Moab, a popular tourist destination in the Utah desert, according to a Facebook post by the Grand County Sheriff’s Department.</p><p>All four passengers were killed, and the sheriff’s office claims that the senator was the plane’s pilot. A plane carrying Senator Doug Larsen, his wife Amy, and their two young children crashed in Utah the night before, and Hogue forwarded the news to the Senate.</p><p>They had recently returned from a visit to their Scottsdale, Arizona, family. They made a pit stop for petrol in Utah.</p><p>Hogue commented, “I have no idea where the grieving process begins in the wake of such a tragedy, but I would imagine it begins with prayers for the grandparents, surviving stepchild of Senator Larsen, and extended family of Doug and Amy.” “Today, gather your loved ones around you. A bouquet of roses was put on Senator Larsen’s desk in the Senate chamber, directly in front of his nameplate, which reads “D. Larsen – District 34.”</p><h2><strong>What was the net worth of Doug Larsen?</strong></h2><p>Information concerning the net worth of North Dakota Senator, Doug Larsen, is unknown. However, judging from his businesses and being a Senator, we could deduce that the North Dakota Senator may probably be worth millions of dollars.</p><h2><strong>Who was Doug Larsen’s wife, Amy?</strong></h2><p>Doug Larsen, his wife Amy Larsen, and their two children died in a plane crash on October 1, 2023.</p><p>They were on their way back to North Dakota that Sunday. Over the weekend, they went to Scottsdale, Arizona to see family.</p><p>But the small plane they were in crashed near Moab, Utah, after stopping to gas. The next day, Senator David Hogue told everyone about the accident.</p><p>In an email to Larsen’s fellow senators, he said, “Senator Doug Larsen, his wife Amy, and their two young children died in a plane crash last evening in Utah.”</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a> <span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span> <span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCwzq6eZqSRp8CmuoycmK6rlWK8p3nDnpitoF2kr6rA1JqpsmWWqrumvsClZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gloria-gaynor-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-463234-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gloria Gaynor Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
