According to the show and per the real-life story, Amy was already separated or divorced from Richard when Charles Cullen turned heads with his killings. In the show, Amy has been shown as a single mother which is parallel to her real life from that time.</p><p>There isn’t much about when they met and got married. There are no dockets publicly available on the web which give a glimpse of the time period of their divorce.</p><p>Although Amy doesn’t mention her husband, their daughter Alex has featured him on her socials.

According to Amy, he was humorous. “We connected right away and grew close.” While Cullen appeared to be a loving caregiver, police looking into suspicious deaths at the hospital would eventually identify him as one of the most active serial killers in American history with Loughren’s assistance.</p><p>After learning the truth about her friend, Amy agreed to help Somerset County Police Department investigators covertly record conversations with Charles Cullen. Eventually, she was able to get her ex-friend to admit to killing patients by injecting lethal doses of insulin and heart medications into their IV bags.</p><p>The Good Nurse, starring Jessica Chastain as Loughren and Eddie Redmayne as Cullen, is based on the true story of how Loughren put an end to Cullen’s murdering spree. Nnamdi Asomugha plays Detective Danny Baldwin in the movie, which is based on the 2014 Charles Graeber book The Good Nurse: A True Story of Medicine, Madness, and Murder.
