Her picture, which showed her to be unrecognizable, raised suspicions about her attempts to evade detection.</p><p>She reportedly changed her hair and had cosmetic surgery done while she was on the run.</p><p>Armstrong had drastically changed her look, according to Deputy US Marshal Brendan Filla, shaving her hair to her shoulders and donning a bandage.</p><p>Two passports were discovered in a locker, according to Zachary Paulsen, who saw her being arrested, suggesting that she was trying to maintain many identities.</p><p>In addition, he brought up a $6,350 bill for cosmetic surgery, raising the possibility that she was trying to alter her appearance.</p><p>The mugshot of Kaitlin Armstrong showed that she had blood in her nose, maybe from the operation or something she had done while trying to flee.</p><p>She now faces a murder accusation and a trial for her alleged actions, thus her return to the United States on July 2nd marked a turning point in her path.</p><h2><span id=Killer_Moriah_Wilson_Trial_and_Judgment_of_Kaitlin_Armstrong>Killer Moriah Wilson Trial and Judgment of Kaitlin Armstrong</span></h2><p>The first-degree murder accusation against Kaitlin Armstrong for Moriah Wilson’s death has finally been brought to trial.</p><p>On May 11, 2022, Wilson, a 25-year-old competitive cyclist, was sadly discovered at a friend’s house in Austin, Texas, suffering from several gunshot wounds.</p><p>Given the facts of the case, authorities thought that she had been singled out for gunfire.</p><p>This is a crucial case; the trial’s jury selection was finished on October 30 and the opening arguments are set to begin on November 1.</p><p>Because of the personal ties between the parties, the case takes an intriguing turn.</p><p>Moriah Wilson was romantically involved with the partner of Armstrong, a famous cyclist. Sadly, she was discovered shot a few hours after they had met.</p><h2><span id=According_to_the_arrest_warrant_document>According to the arrest warrant document</span></h2><p>Armstrong’s 2012 Jeep Cherokee was seen stopping outside the house on the night of the murder on surveillance video from a neighboring household.</p><p>Armstrong’s post-incident activities further complicated the case. She left Austin soon after the police questioned her about the shooting, which sparked a national hunt for her.</p><p>On June 29, 2022, she was apprehended in a hostel in Costa Rica, after having been on the run for 43 days.</p><p>Her mugshot and alleged cosmetic surgery expenditures both show that she changed her look while she was on the run, as was previously indicated.</p><p>The case has become even more intriguing as a result of their attempts to elude law enforcement.</p><p>The judicial system will decide Kaitlin Armstrong’s fate as the trial goes on; her actions and intentions on that fateful May night are still being closely examined.</p><p>The case is a sobering reminder of the terrible outcomes that may result from interpersonal conflicts and the difficulties of administering justice in such cases.</p><p>The trial’s fate is still up in the air, and the decision will be very important to Moriah Wilson’s quest for justice as well as the case’s resolution.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
