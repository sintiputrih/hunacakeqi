He is a singer and songwriter widely known as Zayn Malik. He is the former member of the popular boy band One Direction. Since 2015, Zayn is signed to RCA Records as a solo artist. Zayn Malik has been accumulating his net worth being active in show business since 2010.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Zayn Malik? Reportedly, the outright size of his wealth is equal to $23 million. The main source of Zayn wealth is the music band <a href=#>One Direction</a>, and it has been estimated that since the start of their career <a href=#>One Direction</a> has earned $100 million, coming from songs, DVDs, discs, publishing, endorsement deals and merchandising.</p><h3>Zayn Malik Net Worth $23 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Zayn Malik grew up in East Bowling, Bradford. Malik was raised in a Muslim household as his father is British-Pakistani, and his mother converted to Islam prior their marriage. He studied at Lower Fields Primary School, and later, at Tong High School. He was interested in performing arts and was seen in various productions at school. In 2010, Zayn auditioned for the reality competition show “The X Factor” (2010) as a solo act, and passed the first round although later was eliminated from the show. However, judges <a href=#>Simon Cowel</a> and <a href=#>Nicole Scherzinger</a> gave him a second chance to continue participation in the form of a boy band together with <a href=#>Louis Tomlinson</a>, <a href=#>Liam Payne</a>, <a href=#>Niall Horan</a> and <a href=#>Harry Styles</a>. Zayn accepted the offer which later became a financially profitable career. The band was named <a href=#>One Direction</a> and managed to reach the finals of the show, and ended up in third place. Afterwards, the band signed to Syco Records, and since then they have released 4 studio albums, two EPs, 14 singles, a video album and 14 music videos. All four studio albums, “Up All Night” (2011), “Take Me Home” (2012), “Midnight Memories” (2013) and “Four” (2014), topped the music charts not only in UK, but in many countries all over the world. More, all the albums were certified multi-platinum in the UK, USA and other countries.</p><p>It has been estimated that the band has sold more than 50 million records all over the world which undoubtedly added sums to the total size of Zayn Malik net worth. In addition to the number of awards received being a member of a boy band, Zayn Malik has won 4Music Video Honours Award in the category the Cutest Celeb Couple with Perrie Edwards, as well as The Asian Award for an Outstanding Contribution to Music.</p><p>After several discussions with producer Naughty Boy, Malik decided to leave the band and concentrate on his solo career. Since 2015, he is signed to RCA Records as a solo artist. Obviously the anticipation is that a solo career will be more successful than the one landed in the <a href=#>One Direction</a> band. Time will tell.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the singer, Malik was dating the singer Rebecca Ferguson despite the fact that she is six years older. Later, he was in a relationship with another singer Perrie Edwards; the two became engaged in 2013, however, it has been announced that the couple split up in 2015. Currently, Zayn Malik is single.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.080168776371><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$23 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 12, 1993</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>East Bowling, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Musician, Disc jockey, Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>England</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Trisha Malik, Yaser Malik</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Waliyha Malik, Safaa Malik, Doniya Malik</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nicknames</td><td>Zain Javadd Malik , Zayn , Zayn Jawaad Malik , Zayn Javadd Malik , Dj Malik , Bradford Bad Boy , Zain Javadd "Zayn" Malik</td></tr><tr readability=0.39024390243902><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/zaynmalik</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/zaynmalik</a></td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjrOYsqZdoq6ttcpmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./interview-brockhampton-roadrunner-final-albums-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brockhampton Is Ready to Leave a Hell of a Legacy Behind">&larr;
