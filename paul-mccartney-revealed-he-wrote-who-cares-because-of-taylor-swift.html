And I was going to be asking you to play with me," McCartney told Swift.</p><p>"Were you going to invite me?" Swift asked. "I was hoping that you would. I was going to ask you."</p><p>"I would’ve done ‘Shake It Off,’" McCartney revealed.

"He’d send me a track; he’d make new tracks, add to the folder; I would write the entire top line for a song, and he wouldn’t know what the song would be about, what it was going to be called, where I was going to put the chorus.I had originally thought, ‘Maybe I’ll make an album in the next year, and put it out in January or something,’ but it ended up being done and we put it out in July."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "And I just thought there are no rules anymore, because I used to put all these parameters on myself, like, ‘How will this song sound in a stadium? How will this song sound on radio?’ If you take away all the parameters, what do you make? And I guess the answer is ‘Folklore.’"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Taylor Lautner Regrets Laughing When Taylor Swift Got Interrupted By Kanye West At The VMAs</a></span></p><p>McCartney said that he had a similar attitude while making his album.</p><p>"It’s more music for yourself than music that’s got to go do a job," McCartney explained. "My thing was similar to that: After having done this little bit of film music, I had a lot of stuff that I had been working on… and it’d be left half-finished. So I just started saying, ‘Well, what about that? I never finished that.’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, "And because it didn’t have to amount to anything, I would say, ‘Ah, I really want to do tape loops. I don’t care if they fit on this song, I just want to do some.’ So I go and make some tape loops, and put them in the song, just really trying to do stuff that I fancy. … I had no idea it would end up as an album; I may have been a bit less indulgent."</p><h2 id=paul-mccartney-wrote-his-song-39-who-cares-39-about-taylor-and-her-relationship-with-her-fans>Paul McCartney Wrote His Song 'Who Cares' About Taylor And Her Relationship With Her Fans</h2><p>When McCartney released his album "Egypt Station," many of his fans were surprised to learn that one of its tracks was inspired by Swift. The song "Who Cares" is mainly inspired by Swift's personal life and her relationship with her fans.</p><p>McCartney spoke about Swift and the song's inspiration in a BBC interview.</p><p>"I was actually thinking about Taylor Swift and her relationship to her young fans and how it’s sort of a sisterly thing," McCartney said. "And I was imagining talking to one of these young fans and saying, ‘Have you ever been bullied? Do you get bullied?’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>McCartney would later reveal to Howard Stern</a> that he knew of Swift's second surprise album of 2020 before everyone else.</p><p>"I did the Rolling Stone cover with Taylor Swift and she just emailed me recently and she said, ‘I wasn’t telling anyone, but I’ve got another album,’ what’s it called… 'Evermore?’" he spilled.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dave Grohl Once Performed A Classic Foo Fighters Song With Taylor Swift, But Nobody Will Ever Hear The Duet</a></span></p><p>McCartney even revealed Swift decided to move her album release date, as he was planning on releasing an album the same day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"‘So I was going to put it out on my birthday’ — which I think was the 10th. And then she said, ‘but I found out that you were going to put it out on the 10th so I moved to the 18th.’ And then she found out we were coming out on the 18th, so she moved back to the 10th. So, you know, people do keep out of each other’s way.
