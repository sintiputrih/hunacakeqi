Robert Oppenheimer’s role in developing the atomic bomb,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Oppenheimer</strong></a>&nbsp;has captivated audiences worldwide. The film, directed by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christopher Nolan</a>&nbsp;and released in theaters on July 21, 2023, has already earned over $180 million worldwide and received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its cast, screenplay, and visuals. Of course, this success is partly owed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon</a>&nbsp;on social media, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=648 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>Still, the success of&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;as a whole is a tribute to Christopher Nolan’s skill as a director, as evidenced by the film’s gripping narrative, brilliant performances, and provocative ideas. It sheds light on the life of a mysterious historical figure and encourages contemplation of the moral weight of scientific advances and the consequence of personal decisions. You’re in luck if you liked or are curious about this biographical thriller and want to watch other films with comparable themes (such as science, history, and ethical quandaries). Here are 10 other great movies that are just as compelling as&nbsp;Oppenheimer.</p><h2 id=h-10-tesla-2020 data-injectable=false>10.&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;(2020)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>The biographical drama,&nbsp;Tesla, delves into the complicated life of the Serbian-American scientist Nikola Tesla, played by Ethan Hawke, who contributed significantly to advancing technologies that are now considered the backbone of contemporary electrical infrastructure. Tesla’s contributions to electromagnetism and wireless radio communications were enormous, although he is less well-known than his colleagues Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=612 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>Directed by Michael Almereyda, the film’s storyline is nontraditional, taking a more experimental route than a straightforward one. The story’s nonlinear progression, featuring fictional scenarios, modern allusions, and anachronistic occurrences, represents Tesla’s futuristic outlook and thoughts. The film is ostensibly a historical drama, although contemporary references exist. Scenes when characters employ technology that existed long after Tesla’s death are included. While unexpected, these choices ultimately support the film’s central notion of Tesla as a visionary.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-9-arrival-2016 data-injectable=false>9.&nbsp;Arrival&nbsp;(2016)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=true>Directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Eric Heisserer,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrival&nbsp;is a science fiction film</a>&nbsp;based on the award-winning short story by Ted Chiang,&nbsp;“Story of Your Life.” The plot revolves around 12 alien spaceships that land in various parts of the world. Professor of linguistics Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and theoretical physicist Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are hired by the United States military to decipher the aliens’ language and establish communication. Forest Whitaker plays the role of Colonel Weber, the military officer overseeing the operation.</p><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>When compared to other alien invasion films,&nbsp;Arrival&nbsp;stands out because it focuses less on fighting and more on listening and working together. Complex subjects like time, memory, and the meaning of human existence are explored with a reflective and philosophical narrative tone. The film focuses mainly on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, a theory of linguistic relativity that posits that a language’s structure influences the worldview or cognition of its speakers. Dr. Banks’ view of time shifts as she studies the alien language, triggering a chain of dreams or visions of her daughter.</p><h2 id=h-8-the-current-war-2017 data-injectable=false>8.

The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison, Michael Shannon as George Westinghouse, Nicholas Hoult as Nikola Tesla, and Tom Holland as Samuel Insull. The film depicts the late 19th-century competition between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse to develop and commercialize a sustainable electrical infrastructure in the United States. This struggle, known as the “War of the Currents,” was centered on the two opposing electrical current systems: Edison’s direct current (DC) and Westinghouse’s alternating current (AC).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Edison, the brilliant inventor and self-promoter, is presented as devoted to his DC system and prepared to go to any length to secure its success, including a smear campaign against AC. Westinghouse is shown as a more reticent figure who believes in the supremacy and efficiency of his AC system. Tesla, who worked for Edison before joining Westinghouse, is essential in the AC/DC debate. The film follows these characters’ professional and personal lives, heated rivalry, technological advancements, and enormous impact on constructing the contemporary world.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-7-radioactive-2019 data-injectable=false>7.

Rosamund Pike plays the famous physicist and chemist, while Sam Riley plays her husband, Pierre Curie. The film provides an in-depth look at Marie Curie’s life and accomplishments, beginning with her innovative work in Paris at the turn of the 20th century. To this day, Curie is the only person to have earned Nobel Prizes in both Physics and Chemistry for her groundbreaking work that led to the discovery of polonium and radium and the formulation of the theory of radioactivity.</p><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>Beyond the traditional biography,&nbsp;Radioactive&nbsp;interweaves scenes that show the long-term effects of the Curies’ discoveries, such as the creation of medical remedies, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Chornobyl disaster. These instances highlight the beneficial and harmful consequences of their efforts. While Marie Curie’s scientific achievements are the primary emphasis of the film, the personal ties between Marie, Pierre, and their daughters, as well as her affair with physicist Paul Langevin following Pierre’s death and the subsequent scandal, are also explored.</p><h2 id=h-6-the-theory-of-everything-2014 data-injectable=false>6.&nbsp;The Theory of Everything&nbsp;(2014)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>The Theory of Everything&nbsp;is a biographical romantic drama directed by James Marsh. The screenplay by Anthony McCarten is based on the memoir&nbsp;Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen&nbsp;by Jane Hawking. Beginning with his time as a Ph.D. student at Cambridge University in the 1960s, the film follows the life of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). It explores his groundbreaking research and speculations on cosmology, black holes, and the big bang.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>However, the film is not only about Hawking’s scientific achievements; it also focuses on his personal life, particularly his relationship with his wife, Jane Wilde Hawking (Felicity Jones), and the challenges posed by his diagnosis with motor neuron disease (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease), which gradually paralyzed him over the decades.&nbsp;The Theory of Everything&nbsp;is a love story and a biographical drama. It depicts Stephen and Jane’s relationship with warmth and sensitivity, from their early romance and marriage to the stresses of Stephen’s sickness and popularity, to their eventual separation.</p><h2 id=h-5-the-man-who-knew-infinity-2015 data-injectable=false>5.&nbsp;The Man Who Knew Infinity&nbsp;(2015)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>Adapted from Robert Kanigel’s 1991 non-fiction book of the same name, Matthew Brown’s&nbsp;The Man Who Knew Infinity&nbsp;is a biographical drama film about Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (Dev Patel) and his instructor G. H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons). The picture delves into the life of Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematical genius from Madras, India. Ramanujan, who had no academic experience in mathematics, devised innovative theories, many of which he claimed to have had in dreams.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>In the film, Ramanujan accepts an invitation from the famous mathematician G.H. Hardy to work at Cambridge University in England during World War I, leaving behind his young wife Janaki (Devika Bhise). Hardy recognizes Ramanujan’s genius despite the latter’s unusual techniques and lack of formal schooling, becoming his mentor and passionate defender against the prevailing racial and cultural biases of the time. Ramanujan significantly contributed to mathematics, particularly in number theory and infinite series.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-4-hidden-figures-2016 data-injectable=false>4.&nbsp;Hidden Figures&nbsp;(2016)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=773 data-injectable=true>Starring Taraji P.

The Bombe machine was created by Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park, Britain’s top-secret code-breaking headquarters, to interpret the Enigma-encrypted transmissions.</p><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>Benedict Cumberbatch’s portrayal of Turing captures his intelligence and the social awkwardness, drive, and emotional suffering he endured as a closeted gay man when homosexuality was illegal in Britain. Keira Knightley stars as code-breaker Joan Clarke, who becomes Alan Turing’s closest friend and briefly engaged fiancée. She gives a fantastic portrayal that brings to life Clarke’s struggles with sexism in a male-dominated sector and her friendship with Alan Turing. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film received eight nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (Tyldum), Best Actor (Cumberbatch), and Best Supporting Actress (Knightley). It won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.</p><h2 id=h-2-interstellar-2014 data-injectable=false>2.&nbsp;Interstellar&nbsp;(2014)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Interstellar</a>&nbsp;is a science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine.
