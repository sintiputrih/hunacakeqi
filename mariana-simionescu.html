This next sports personality is none other than former world-class Romanian&nbsp;tennis player, <strong>Mariana Simionescu</strong>. She showed her best Grand Slam performance at the fourth round of The Championships (also known as Wimbledon).</p><p>Simionescu won her last major title in Tokyo Tournament defeating her opponent, <strong>Nerida Gregory </strong>with a score of 6-4 in the late <i>1970s</i>. So, is she married again? Who is her current husband? Let's take a glance of Simionescu's personal life below.</p><h2>What is Current Marital Status of Mariana Simionescu?</h2><p>The <i>64-year-old</i>, Mariana has had a very popular love life like her professional career. Back in the mid-<i>1970s </i>and early-<i>1980s</i>, she frequently faced various rumors and controversies because of her past love affairs.</p><p>Though having such romantic history, she is currently enjoying her life as a single woman after facing traumatic end in relationships. Till date, she is lives in the suburb area of Monaco. Likewise, <i>Game of Thrones</i> actress, <a href=#><strong>Lena Headey</strong></a> stays single following her two tragic divorces.</p><h2>From Marina's First Meeting with Bjorn Borg to Tying the Knot...</h2><p>One of the most highlighted love stories in the sports was Mariana and <strong>Bjorn Borg</strong>'s broken marriage. The couple had their first encounter at The French Open in Paris, France. But, they interacted during the birthday party of Bjorn's tennis coach on <i>10th June 1976</i>.</p><p>However, the duo had a language barrier for almost a year which they disclosed in an interview. Despite the fact, they accepted one another as husband and wife &nbsp;on <i>24th July 1980</i> at the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bucharest City Hall </a>in Bucharest, Romania after dating for four years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/16/Webp.net-resizeimage%20-%202021-06-16T211352.183-1623857652412.jpg><p>The whole world shocked when the pair announced their separation and filed for divorce after four years marriage. They later concluded their divorce at the end of <i>1984</i>. At that time, there were some rumors that Mariana received <strong>$8,340,360 </strong>(<strong>Â£6,000,000</strong>) as a <a href=# rel=nofollow>divorce alimony</a> from Bjorn, but it was absolutely not true.</p><h2>Past Marital Affairs of Mariana's Ex-Husband, Borg</h2><p>Following the divorce settlement, Mariana's estranged husband, Bjorn became involved in a romantic relationship with a Swedish model, <strong>Jannike Bjorling</strong>. Later, they welcomed a son, <strong>Robin Bjorling Borg </strong>in <i>1985</i>. However, they split up in <i>1989</i>, due to some misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p><p>Mariana's ex-marital partner, Borg, further, exchanged his wedding vows with an Italian singer, <strong>Loredana Berte</strong> in <i>1989</i>. The marriage lasted five years until they concluded their conjugal relationship with a divorce agreement citing irreconcilable differences in <i>1993</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/28/1-1624870352538.jpg><p>After the divorce, Simionescu's former spouse, Borg tied the knot with <strong>Patricia Ostfeld </strong>on <i>8th June 2002</i>. Following a year, they found the bundle of joy when they became parents of their first child, baby boy, <strong>Leo Borg</strong>. As of now, their son has become a profound tennis player and actor, who acted as a young Bjorn Borg in the biographical film, <i>Borg vs. McEnroe</i> in <i>2017</i>.</p><h2>How was Mariana's Relationship with Jean-Louis Schlesser?</h2><p>Former Grand Slam champion, Simionescu was in a live-in relationship with a former French racing driver, <strong>Jean-Louis Schlesser, </strong>who competed in the FIA Formula One World Championship. The couple were romantically involved in their relationship for so many years since Mariana's marriage ended drastically.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/16/Webp.net-resizeimage%20-%202021-06-16T211419.970-1623857644000.jpg><p>The former couple stayed in a live-in relationship for several years, but separated lately. However, the reason behind their breakup is still a mystery to their fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/28/3-1624863440958.jpg><p>Despite their split, they share a child, <strong>Anthony Schlesser </strong>(born in <i>1990</i>), who is now <i>31</i> years old. He is competing as a drag racer in the Africa Eco Race (also known as Dakar Rally).
