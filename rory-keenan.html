The intimate ceremony took place at the exclusive Ballybeg House in Co Wicklow.</p><p>They’ve been dating since 2017 when they both appeared in George Bernard Shaw’s West End play St Joan. After going public with their relationship at some stage in 2018, the pair were spotted together several times in Dublin.</p><p>In the meantime, there were no further updates on their married life, owing to Rory’s lack of social media activity. And, though Gemma did engage in Instagramming and Tweeting, she made certain that the topics were rarely about her personal life.</p><p>At the time of publishing, it seemed that they had not yet accepted any children into their lives. Gemma claimed in 2013 that she wanted to wait until she had achieved something in the acting world before considering having children.</p><p>Since 2007, the English actress has starred in a slew of blockbuster films, including Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters.</p><p>Rory dated Amy Huberman in the early 2000s before marrying Gemma. Gemma, on the other hand, was previously married to Stefano Catelli. Three years later, in 2013, they divorced, and their divorce was finalized in August 2015. Gemma claimed at the time that she “never really believed in exchanging vows” and is uncertain whether she would “want to walk down the aisle again.”She also dated John Nolan (who she met on the set of Quantum of Solace) and Spanish stuntman Eduardo Munoz in the past.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Sergey Shakurov</a></h3>Sergey Shakurov estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
