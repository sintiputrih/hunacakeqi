This article sheds light on John Buultjens’ wiki facts, net worth, and parents. Let’s get started.</p><h2>John Buultjens Wikipedia-bio</h2><p>John Buultjens is an actor, author, and popular BMX figure. He was born in Scotland to his mother, Margaret Craig, and his abusive father. When he was 3 years old, his father threw him into an electric fire.</p><p>The incident is the worst memory for the actor who has the scars to verify it. At 7 years of age, John ended up in foster care, where Mr. and Mrs. Buultjens adopted him. At first, he was quite uncomfortable with his Sri Lankan brown-skinned father, and it took him six months to accept the family.</p><p>In 1986, the family moved to Dundee, and his parents reside there even now. When John was ten years old, he went to the cinema to watch the movie ‘Extra Terrestrial.’ That ignited his passion for BMX riding and changed the course of his life. Bob Haro was the major stunt man in the movie.</p><p>Today, he is the global manager for Bob’s BMX Empire. At twenty years of age, John moved to Australia and started a new life. There, he worked in different jobs, which included a role in the TV soap opera ‘Neighbours.’ John continued his passion for BMX riding and started collecting bikes. He stayed in the country for a large portion of his life and successfully became a BMX rider.</p><p>In his late thirties, John moved to America. His trauma-filled life story had already garnered much attention. In addition, he had some amazing contacts, which resulted in finalizing his movie ‘The Ride.’</p><p>The movie has received praises and appreciation for the storyline and acting.
