He is a hopeful young animator. Danny influenced him in the 2010 movie “Rabbit Hole.” In any case, most of his notoriety comes from the recognition of the Phoenix family. You are on the right page if you are curious about this young actor’s age and wiki-bio.</p><h2><strong>How old is the Phoenix Ranking? Age and Birthday</strong></h2><p>Phoenix List was born in New York City (September 18, 2004). As of 2021, he is 17 years of age. He was born to his parents John List (father) and Susanna (mother). Essentially, he is the small brother of the twins Payton List (sister) and Spencer List (brother). Phoenix went to the local high school. However, he has been admitted to the school, but the school’s name is vague to ordinary people.</p><p>Phoenix may have followed the footsteps of his siblings for his acting career. His older sister Peyton and younger brother Spencer are now trendy. The recognition of the twins’ relatives made Phoenix the most superficial person.</p><h2><strong>Phoenix List Movies and Career&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Phoenix List follows the example of his siblings in acting. His mature siblings have effectively stated their position in the film industry, and according to all reports, he has currently followed their path.</p><p>Curious Thing’s actor came in the big screen with a short comedy movie, “8 easy step” that got to the public in 2009. Then he played different films and series. ‘Curious Things’ and ‘Montauk‘ were among Phoenix starting films. Later, he was seen in ‘Reform’ and then in ‘Vegas’ as Tim Ludlow.</p><p>Also, Phoenix’s character in ‘American Viral,’ 2014 was famous. He played along with Michael Showalter and Zandy Hartig. But Phoenix’s major hit was the movie ‘Rabbit Hole’ with Nicole Kidman. Other actors like Aaron Eckhart and Sandra Oh also played in the film.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-7200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Phoenix-List-American-actor.jpg alt="Phoenix List celebrating his birthday" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-7200 class=wp-caption-text>An American child actor, Phoenix List</p><h2><strong>Phoenix List net worth&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>All things considered, Phoenix List is in the beginning of his carrier and has a net worth of about $10,000 only. However, his brother Spencer has a net worth of $3 million, while his sister Payton has an expected net worth of $7 million.</p><p>His mother also includes a huge net worth of $1 million. So we would say that List is naturally introduced into a celebrity family and continued to lead an expensive lifestyle.</p><h2><strong>Phoenix List Parents: Suzanne List and John List&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Phoenix’s mother,<strong> Suzanne List</strong>, is a 52-years-old excellent woman. She was born in Florida, the USA, on October 26, 1969. John and Suzanne dated for a short time in Florida before marriage. Father, <strong>John</strong> is a financial expert, and his mother, Suzanne, is an assistant in the space emergency room.</p><p>After marriage, they built a house in Florida together and lived a happy life. However, they needed to stay away from home—a sort of. They went to LA to support their kid’s careers. Suzanne List and John List are the most potent guardians; they have cultivated all three children to be popular and successful.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-7199 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/phoenix-list-siblings-parents.jpg alt="Phoenix List with his family" width=897 height=563 sizes="(max-width: 897px) 100vw, 897px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-7199 class=wp-caption-text>Child American artist Phoenix List with his parents and siblings,&nbsp; Peyton and&nbsp; Spencer</p><h2><strong>Phoenix List Siblings</strong></h2><h2><strong>Peyton List</strong></h2><p>Peyton was born on April 6, 1998, in Florida.
