Although they would love to have his services, he, however, cannot help them due to his injury. Etsebeth had been nursing a broken hand, an injury he acquired after the Lions defeated his team at Ellis Park. During the game, this skilled rugby player was seen seeking treatment for his arms. Later on, just shortly half-time, Etsebeth was seen with his hand strapped.</p><p>The player did not even show up for the second stanza of the game. Initially, the commentators of SuperSport announced that the injured player had broken his ankle. However, it seemed to be a wrong diagnosis since his ankle was alright, but his arm was not. Although Etzebeth has a very public career, he, however, is not very forthcoming with his personal life. He has not revealed to the media whom he is currently dating or has married, making most of his fans assume that he is single.</p><p>Despite these assumptions, we can, however, state the fact that Etsebeth is a very skilled lock player. Fans are sad that he cannot help the Stormers in the 2019 Super Rugby due to his arm injury. However, they are praying for his quick recovery.</p><h2 id=firstHeading class=firstHeading><span class=ez-toc-section id=eben-etzebeth-contract></span><span>Eben Etzebeth Contract</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Etzebeth, who has 75 Springbok caps, signed a two-year contract with the Top 14 outfit, and 2015 Rugby World Cup winner Milner-Skudder will feature for the side for three seasons.</p><p>According to Toulon’s official website, Etzebeth will join the French club at the end of the World Cup in Japan next year.

Also, he can run 40 m in 5.11 seconds, reaching a top speed of 17.4 miles per hour.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eben-etzebeth-rugby-player></span><span>Eben Etzebeth Rugby Player</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Etzebeth is a professional rugby union player.

He recovered from injury in time for the start of the campaign and on 25 February 2012, he debuted against the Hurricanes. In total, he made 13 appearances during the season and managed to score 1 try as the Stormers won 14 of their 16 league matches prior to eventually losing to the Sharks in the semi-finals.</p><p>International commitments kept him out of the early stages of the year 2012 Currie Cup, but he went back at the tail-end of the tournament, winning his first 3 Western Province caps and helping them to lift their first Currie Cup title since the year 2002. He was awarded the Man of the Match award as Province gained revenge on the Sharks with a 25–18 win in Durban.</p><p>Top 14 side Toulon reported Etzebeth would join them after the 2019 Rugby World Cup in December 2018. The injury ruled him out of the first half of the year 2013 Super Rugby season, but he returned for the second. He made a start in January 2021, at Blindside Flank for the first Time after teammate Swan Rebbadj got injured prior to kick off.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eben-etzebeth-bench-press></span><span>Eben Etzebeth Bench Press</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Etzebeth has very impressive upper body strength for man of his huge height and young age, being able to bench press 385 pounds (175 kg) and perform incline dumbbell chest presses with 175 pounds (79 kg) dumbbells.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eben-etzebeth-caps></span><span>Eben Etzebeth Caps</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>International commitments kept Etzebeth out of the early stages of the year 2012 Currie Cup, but he returned to the tail-end of the tournament, winning his first 3 Western Province caps and helping them to lift their first Currie Cup title since the year 2002.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eben-etzebeth-number></span><span>Eben Etzebeth Number</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Etzebeth’s regular playing position is as a number 4 lock.</strong> He currently plays for the South Africa national team and Toulon in the Top 14 in France.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-eben-etzebeth></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Eben Etzebeth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-eben-etzebeth></span><span>Who is Eben Etzebeth?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Etzebeth is a famous professional rugby union player who was born in Cape Town, South Africa.
