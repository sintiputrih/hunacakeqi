According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Nelson was in the driver’s seat of a car crash that left him with serious injuries. Thankfully, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">K.J. Osborn</a>, wide receiver for the Vikings, and three other good Samaritans were in the right place at the right time and were able to assist in rescuing the reality star.</p><p>The MTV star took to his social media to give fans an update on the situation, and shed some light on what actually happened, as well as some graphic images of his injuries. In his tweet, he wrote:</p><p>"I was involved in a car accident. I want to thank kJ: @kj_osborn_ @nfl @vikings for being on the scene and filming my rescue," he said in the tweet. "I am forever grateful to Abdulmejied Hairedin, Rita, and Arthur for pulling me out of a burning vehicle, risking their own lives to save mine."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Words can't explain how grateful I am to be alive," Nelson added.

The star posted a video in which he gave fans some insight into his health.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“So I didn’t feel like I needed to go to the hospital because I was happy and smiling and I think I can get through the pain,” he said. “But this morning, it just got worse. My neck was aching, I was out of breath, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I’m sweating, as you can see I got the chills.”</p><p>Nelson said he was "staying strong" and was going to be transferred to another hospital. He added: "It's a very scary feeling. I didn't know what depression was, [but] I feel like throughout this journey of mine, I felt it." He went on to thank everyone for their support through <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe</a> and DMs and said he was "just thankful to be alive."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSnnZyovK9506GmppmjYsGpsYycn5qknJq7qLE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./angelina-jolie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Angelina Jolie dating?
