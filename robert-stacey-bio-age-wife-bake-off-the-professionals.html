Robert applied to Westminster Kingsway College of Culinary Arts while scrubbing pots and making sandwiches in a local gastropub, and went on to study and work at a variety of South London pubs and clubs.</p><p>Robert soon learned the gritty side of the industry when he bagged a job at Marco Pierre White’s Soho restaurant L’Escargot. After leaving, Robert went on to the bar where he was assistant manager. “At college, I was burning out and doing a bit too much and I needed an understanding of front of house”.</p><p>Learn more about him below in this bio. Here we cover his age, details regarding his wife and children, and his career as a chef. Delve into this Robert Stacey Bio to learn more about him.</p><h3><strong>Robert Stacey On Bake Off: The Professionals</strong></h3><p>The lineup of 8 pairs of professional chefs is ready to compete in Season 5 of Bake Off: The Professionals.
