It has nothing to do with acting - he's accomplished in every metric there. It primarily has to do with his environmental beliefs. While there's no doubt Leo cares about the environment, his views do come off as strange when you consider multiple things. Most of all his carbon footprint. Sure, a lot of wealthy celebrities have a massive carbon footprint, but what makes Leo so different?When he's not on the silver screen or on tabloid covers for his love life, he's typically talking about climate change. His climate change initiates take in donations every single day, a lot of which comes from Leo himself. He's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly donated over $100 million</a>. Not 10 million, no - one hundred million.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Facts About Gigi Hadid & Leonardo DiCaprioâ€™s Relationship</a></span>So, if he has donated that much money, is his carbon footprint that much of a problem? Let's find out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-leonardo-dicaprio-s-views-on-global-warming><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>What Are Leonardo DiCaprio's Views On Global Warming?</span></h2><p>Make no mistake - Leo is a heavy believer in fighting climate change. He rarely talks about other political issues, instead focusing on arguably the biggest issue facing humanity over the next century. His life outside of acting has essentially revolved around global warming, and there are many examples of this. If he has to give a speech or interview for something, he'll bring up the environment. When he finally won an oscar in 2016, he focused his speech on how we can still save the Earth from it's impending doom. He sits on the United Nations board as the Messenger of Peace for Climate Change, as both a reward and challenge for the A-list superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-movies-has-leonardo-made-about-his-views><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Movies Has Leonardo Made About His Views?</span></h2><p>Nearly all of his posts on social media are about climate change in some way. This does have a positive effect when you consider he has over 50 million followers on Instagram and many more on Twitter. But does the <a href=#>career-saving actor</a> do anything in the industry that's made him famous?</p><p>Yes, he actually has.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Major Roles Leonardo DiCaprio Has Turned Down</a></span></p><p>Of course, not all of his roles are going to be about climate change. However, he produced and narrated a documentary titled 'Before The Flood'. The entire film was both educational and a cry for help about the future of our planet. After that documentary, he then starred in the 2021 film 'Don't Look Up'. The movie used an asteroid as a metaphor for climate change. Leo's character ended up ranting on live television about how humanity is responsible for it's own extinction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-leonardo-dicaprio-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Is Leonardo DiCaprio's Net Worth?</span></h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio's obviously accumulated a massive net worth due to the long list of blockbuster movies. he has starred in.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, he's estimated to have a net worth of over $300 million. Over time, the price for Leonardo's acting has only gone up. One of his highest-paying roles was for 'Inception', which paid him $10 million.</p><h2 id=what-has-leonardo-bought-that-conflicts-with-his-views><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Has Leonardo Bought That Conflicts With His Views?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, just like every multi-millionaire, Leonardo's bought some rather expensive things. That alone might not be a problem. However, some of the things he's purchased definitely conflict with his climate change stance.</p><p>His most scandalous purchases are actually rentals of super-yachts. His rentals of these yachts cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars according to Vanity Fair. These yachts don't help with pollution at all, which will be discussed later on in this article. According to Fox News, not only does Leonardo fly a lot, but he also reportedly flies over 8,000 miles per year on "gas-guzzling" private jets.</p><h2 id=what-else-has-leo-bought-with-his-massive-net-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Else Has Leo Bought With His Massive Net Worth?</span></h2><p>There's also a long list of things Leo has purchased that aren't quite as damaging to the environment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How A Skydiving Experience Almost Cost Leonardo DiCaprio His Life</a></span></p><p>The area where he puts most of his money in are his homes. The latest real estate purchase he's made happens to be <a href=#>a remote and luxurious Beverly Hills mansion</a>. He got it around the time he broke up with Camila Morrone, so at least he has something of a consolation for his heartbreak.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-size-of-leonardo-dicaprio-s-carbon-footprint><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Is The Size Of Leonardo DiCaprio's Carbon Footprint</span></h2><p>Sadly enough, Leonardo does have quite the carbon footprint. Due to both his fame and him being outspoken on climate change, many fans and critics alike have followed his carbon footprint closely. He's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated to account for 500 times</a> the emissions of the average person. These mostly come from his usage of yachts and jets. Still, it's something the activist shouldn't be proud for. Even if he's a celebrity that has to travel around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=which-celebrities-care-about-climate-change><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Which Celebrities Care About Climate Change?</span></h2><p>Other celebrities that are extremely vocal about climate change include Prince Harry, Shailene Woodley, and Jane Fonda.</p><p>Prince Harry mainly advocates for climate change in interviews and with donations. Jane and Shailene do those things, while also advocating for climate change on the front lines. Shaliene even once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about her views on climate change for Time magazine</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqeelr%2Blu4ydoJyZoKe2sHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal50qmcp5yZo7Rur8uipJqslWK1urzOnKmirJVk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kylie-jenner-postpartum-symptoms.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kylie Jenner Says Postpartum Symptoms Are Slowing Her Down">&larr;
