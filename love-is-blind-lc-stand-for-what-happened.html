Fans are curious about <a href=#>Jessica Batten's engagement</a> and also can't get enough of the juicy story of her relationship with Mark Cuevas on the show. There's another cast member who fans love and that's Lauren Chamblin. The reality star, who likes going by "LC," was also interested in starting a relationship with Matt Barnett and it was sad to see him leave her behind and choose Amber Pike. While many fans think that Barnett and Amber are adorable together, LC hasn't been lucky in love and she seems so sweet that it's a real shame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Love Is Blind': What Has Mark Cuevas Been Up To Since The Show Ended?</a></span></p><p>Season 1 of Love Is Blind began streaming on Netflix in February 2020 and according to Pop Sugar, the episodes were filmed in 2018.

On the one hand, the cast members spent a lot of time together when they weren't talking to potential partners in the pods, and they got a chance to get to know each other and connect.

I challenge you to register if you’re not and to ask at least 2 others if they are registered!
