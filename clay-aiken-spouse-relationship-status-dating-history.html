Wondering where have you heard this name before? Well, if you’re an </span><i><span>American Idol</span></i><span> fan, he is the spiky-haired guy who lost to Ruben Studdard during its season 2 in 2003.</span></p><p><span>So, what have we missed since we last saw him? What’s his relationship status now? Does he have a spouse or is he still enjoying the dating game? Find answers as you scroll down.</span></p><h3><b>Does Clay Aiken Have A Spouse?</b></h3><p><span>Clay Aiken was rumored to be romantically linked with the dance Thayne Jasperson, but we have no idea if the two ever married. So, it’s hard to say if Clay Aiken has a spouse or not.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, the duo were together since early 2016. At the time, Clay even took it to his IG to post a picture of his rumored boyfriend besides his dog, captioned, “Hey @thaynejasperson when I asked you to dog sit, this isn’t exactly what I meant!”</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to June 2020, Clay and Thayne made another rare appearance over Clay’s IG, captioned, “I’ve been told we never take any pictures together.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Was the singer inconspicuously dropping a hint about them?</span></p><p><span>Also, that was the last time we ever saw the couple.</span></p><p><span>If you’re interested in Clay’s possible spouse, Thayne Jasperson is a dancer born on July 27, 1980. He is well known for appearing in TV shows like </span><i><span>Submissions Onl</span></i><span>y (2014), </span><i><span>Smash </span></i><span>(2012), and</span><i><span> High School Musical </span></i><span>(2006).</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, Clay was busy running his campaign to represent the newly drawn 6th district in North Carolina. If he emerges victorious, he promises to give a voice to those who want to bring sanity and civility back to the political conversation. Especially, his main focus will be on stopping climate change, systemic racism, income inequality, and gun violence.</span></p><h3><b>Clay Aiken Relationship Status</b></h3><p><span>Clay Aiken is a private person. The singer remained tight-lipped about his relationship status ever since his breakup with Jeff Walters.</span></p><p><span>But though he was quite stingy with his relationship details, Clay openly talked about his sexuality.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Yes, I’m Gay,” Clay once shared with the People magazine in 2008 before revealing he was also a father. According to him, he came clean because he c</span><span>annot raise a child to lie or to hide things </span><span>— “I wasn’t raised that way, and I’m not going to raise a child to do that,” he added.</span></p><p><span>His child, Parker Foster Aiken (13 years of age in 2022) was born after the singer artificially inseminated his friend and record producer, Jaymes Foster.</span></p><h3><b>Clay Aiken Dating History</b></h3><p><span>Clay Aiken’s first known relationship was with the Broadway performer and </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span> contestant Reed Kelly. The two got together in late 2008 (after meeting through Clay‘s piano player) and went on to cherish over a year of a relationship.</span></p><p><span>After Reed came Clay’s relationship with Devin Finn, and the theater actor/underwear model Jeff Walters.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, Clay and Jeff started dating back in late 2010 and called it quits in 2011.</span></p><p><span>Talking a little about his exes, Reed is a Saint Paul, MN native, who attended </span><i><span>Hill-Murray High School</span></i><span>. He has worked on Broadway shows like </span><i><span>Wicked, The Addams Family, Spider-man: Turn Off The Dark</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Cirque Du Soleil’s Paramour</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, Reed has appeared on the shows </span><i><span>Smash</span></i><span> (2013), and </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span> (2014).</span></p><p><span>As for Jeff Walters, he is a theater actor whose NSFW images leaked around the time he was in a relationship with Clay.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Can Clay Aiken Still Sing?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Yes, Clay Aiken can still sing. His voice still melts many hearts.</span></p><p><span>His last single was released in 2019 called “O Holy Night.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Also, he sang “White Christmas” on live TV in Dec 2018.</span></p><p><span>Before that, Clay has released many albums such as </span><i><span>Tired & True </span></i><span>(2010), </span><i><span>On My Way Here </span></i><span>(2008), </span><i><span>A Thousand Different Ways </span></i><span>(2006), </span><i><span>Merry Christmas With Love</span></i><span> (2004), and</span><i><span> Measure of a Man</span></i><span> (2003).</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>How Much Is Clay Aiken Net Worth?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Clay Aiken garnered a net worth of under $1 million by 2022.</span></p><p><span>Besides singing, Clay has worked as an ambassador of </span><i><span>UNICEF USA </span></i><span>from Nov 2004 to Dec 2013. Also, he has been the president of </span><i><span>Duraleigh Media</span></i><span> and co-founder of the </span><i><span>National Inclusion Project</span></i><span> ever since 2003.</span></p><p><span>As for his education, he has a bachelor’s degree in special education and teaching from the </span><i><span>University of North Carolina at Charlotte</span></i><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>What Do We Know About Clay Aiken’s Family?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Clay Aiken comes from a mixed family. His&nbsp;</span><span>mother Faye Aiken Parker and his biological father Vernon Grissom have long divorced. After the split, Faye went on to marry Ray Parker (now passed away). The singer then met his step-brother Jeff and step-sister Amy.</span></p><p><span>Also, a year later his half-brother Brett came into this world.</span></p><p><span>His little brother, Brett is a US veteran.</span></p><p><span>Here’s a little co-incidence you might have not known about: Clay and his American Idol co-contestant Jordan Sasser have lived in the same house at different times. Reportedly, Aiken’s mother bought the Raleigh house from Jordan’s grandparents in 1986 and has lived in it ever since.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is Clay Aiken?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Clay Aiken was born on November 30, 1978, making him 43 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p>Find him on IG @<a href=#>clayaiken</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmnKSRrnqitcqepWaroKTCtLGMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZquklsG2v4ydmK2hnpx6qbXSraarsV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./marius-biegai-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marius Biegai Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
