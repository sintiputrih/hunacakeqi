Texas-born rapper, singer, and producer <a href=#>Kevin Abstract</a> only wanted to start a band, an “all-American boy band.” The gifted friends and collaborators he found along the way — some from Texas and others from Connecticut, Florida, Ireland, and elsewhere — flouted boy-band convention. They represented a variety of races, regions, and sexual orientations. They worked out their issues in their art, making music about the quest to find happiness where predecessors in the field sang songs about teenage relationship drama. Brockhampton songs take unexpected twists thanks to the emotional honesty of their lyricists, the creativity of their producers, and the uniqueness of the individual members’ minds and voices; as time passed, the collective would use those differences to its advantage, structuring daring changes around these shifts in perspective. A willingness to grow and change paid off in 2018, when <a href=#>Iridescence</a>, the group’s fourth album, debuted on top of the Billboard 200 chart, and also the next year, when fifth album Ginger’s R&B confection “<a href=#>Sugar</a>” impacted the Hot 100, lingering long enough beneath the top 40 to earn Brockhampton its first legitimate chart hit and platinum-selling single.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtl72y001e3g6fban06qr6@published data-word-count=247>It hasn’t necessarily been the smoothest ride. In the wake of allegations of abuse and the firing of rapper <a href=#>Ameer Vann</a> three years ago, everyone seems a little more guarded than they were a few years prior. The loss of Russell “Joba” Boring’s father last year was another hard hit. On this spring’s new Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine, Brockhampton ponders the big questions about life and the afterlife while reining in the last two albums’ structural complexities but also giving more shine to Jabari Manwa, longtime producer who’s also a gifted singer and hook writer, and Texas rapper SoGone SoFlexy, who is signed to Kevin Abstract and producer Romil Hemnani’s new label, Video Store. Roadrunner brings us full circle, as a clan of rap-forum friends dreaming of pop stardom nearly a decade ago now rubs elbows with the likes of Danny Brown, <a href=#>Lil Nas X</a>, Shawn Mendes, A$AP Rocky, and others. Roadrunner is Brockhampton’s leanest, rawest release since the Saturation tapes that put them on the map for a lot of fans in 2017, but, to hear Kevin Abstract tell it, the show’s almost over. “2 Brockhampton albums in 2021,” he <a href=#>tweeted</a> in March. “These will be our last.” I spoke with the guys as they prepped for a release-night performance, livestreamed via tech start-up <a href=#>Moment House</a>, about the process of creating Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine and the past, present, and future of Brockhampton. The music may speak to dire times, but spirits were high.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlr78001s3g6fpzsgdjoy@published data-word-count=68><strong>I’m curious what the story behind the new album title is about.</strong><br><strong>Joba: </strong>Just always being on the go, always just looking through life, observing what you can, taking what you can in, and interpreting things as you see them. “New Light,” to me, was speaking to the state of the world and finding new hope. “New Machine” is about a resolidified family unit that isn’t afraid of anything.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwis00273g6fjf76tfz9@published data-word-count=82><strong>Family and faith come up quite a bit on Roadrunner. You’ve touched on both in your music before, but now, there’s a different weight to it. Is that a result of the difficulties of the last year?</strong><br><strong>Joba:</strong> Sometimes you’re reminded after … I feel like a lot of distractions were stripped away from humanity. What else do you really have other than family and faith, or the lack thereof? People need each other, and it’s been a time of separation for everyone.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwiu00293g6fvi3tfc99@published data-word-count=118><strong>Meanwhile, 2021 is a year for reconnecting and figuring out how everyone survived. Last year, most of you were pretty quiet on social media, though. How was 2020 on a collective and individual level for each of you?</strong><br><strong>Matt Champion:</strong> We feel like it was the first time we really took a long time to make an album. Normally, we pump the shit out really quick. We made a bunch of albums, and we made a bunch of songs, and it was constantly going back and forth. It was a lot. I mean, everybody was feeling this whole new way of living. Taking two years to make an album and being in that mind-set is a whole different thing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwiv002b3g6fput3f5ct@published data-word-count=16><strong>You said two years?</strong><br><strong>Romil:</strong> We started working on [Roadrunner] when we turned Ginger in, I think.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwiw002d3g6fz56vt16e@published data-word-count=2><strong>Bearface:</strong> Yeah.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwiw002e3g6fdxxkmf66@published data-word-count=12><strong>Romil:</strong> “Bow Wow” was made, like, a week after Ginger came out.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwiw002f3g6fkrbr7kch@published data-word-count=44><strong>Joba: </strong>Just for myself, 2020 was a very strange year.

We just don’t quite fit in either box.

What drew that out of</strong><br><strong>you?</strong><br><strong>Kevin:</strong> Going left. We just had our biggest song ever happen, and it was very R&B–friendly. I think we’re all like, “Let’s just switch it up.” And we love rap music, so it was cool to get back to rapping and doing shit that felt just different, really. It was more challenging. I think we got comfortable making softer, more melodic songs, which we still love, and you can still hear on this album.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwj900303g6f44ol5gg9@published data-word-count=81><strong>The bars are tighter this time than maybe ever before. How do you get to a better place as an MC?</strong><br><strong>Kevin: </strong>We freestyled a lot for this album, not for the lines that made it in, but we’d rap with each other, freestyle with each other, trade bars, and just push each other. I feel like that’s how it used to be with the first three albums, and with Iridescence a little bit. So we were just getting back to that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwjc00323g6fjekq8v9y@published data-word-count=72><strong>Dom: </strong>I’ve had to spend a lot of time over this past year studying and going back to the drawing board. I kept rethinking how I approached the way I was rapping, what I was rapping about, and how I was rapping about it. Having that time to be able to figure things out, to be able to really refine things, that’s definitely one of the privileges that this time gave me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cknhtlwjd00333g6f9xs7l9mv@published data-word-count=7><strong>Merlyn:</strong> I … read books.

Reading really opens up perspectives and changes your approach.</strong><br><strong>Merlyn: </strong>I was in HK’s room watching this Pharrell interview from a long time ago. Pharrell goes to EB Games at the mall and says, “It’s essential that the plastic bag look like the ruffled sheets at the end of your bed when you don’t want to get out bed,” or some shit.

But that didn’t resonate with what was going on in the world.
