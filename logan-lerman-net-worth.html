Logan is an actor who began as a child actor in commercials when just a few years old, but is perhaps best known for his role of D; Artagnan in <a href=#>Paul W. S.

Having matriculated from Beverley Hills High School, Logan chose to work in the film industry, despite most of his family members doing jobs related to medicine. He opened his net worth as a child actor, appearing in <a href=#>Nancy Meyers</a> directed film ‘What Women Want’ in 2000, and his second film already brought him a nomination for Young Artist Award for the Best Ensemble in a Feature Film for his role of William Martin in a film ‘The Patriot’ directed by <a href=#>Roland Emmerich</a>. A year later, he took part in the film ‘Riding in Cars With Boys’ directed by <a href=#>Penny Marshall</a>. In 2003 Logan increased his net worth by attracting critics’ attention for his leading role in the television film ‘A Painted House’ directed by Alfonso Arau after which he won a Young Artist Award for the Best Performance in a TV Movie as the Best Leading Actor. Later, Lerman added much to his net worth starring in the thriller ‘The Butterfly Effect’ directed by Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, which received critical praise and was loved by cinema goers as the box office grossed $96 million. In addition to this, Logan won one more Young Artist Award for his role in the television series ‘Jack & Bobby’ created by Greg Berlanti, Steven A. Cohen, Vanessa Taylor and <a href=#>Brad Meltzer</a> in which Logan co-starred with <a href=#>Christine Lahti</a> and Matt Long.

S. Anderson</a>.</p><p>However, Lerman’s net worth jumped at the peak of his career to date in the leading role in the film ‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’ directed by Stephen Chbosky, for which he received five nominations for awards, and won a San Diego Film Critics Society Award for the Best Performance by an Ensemble and a Teen Choice Award for the Choice Movie Actor in Drama films. The latest roles of Logan were Lou in ‘Stuck in Love’ directed by Josh Boone, Percy Jackson in ‘Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters’ directed by Thor Freudenthal, Ham in ‘Noah’ directed by <a href=#>Darren Aronofsky</a>, and the war film written and directed by <a href=#>David Ayer</a> ‘Fury’, in which Lerman co-stars with <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf</a> and <a href=#>Scott Eastwood</a>. Todate Logan has been involved in over 30 film and TV productions, while still being just 24 years old.</p><p>As to Logan’s personal life, any relationships are as yet private – he enjoys music and is a member of a not serious band in which he plays the piano, and dabbles in writing music.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.271698113208><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Logan Lerman</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 19, 1992</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Beverly Hills, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>143 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Musician</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Beverly Hills High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Larry Lerman, Lisa Goldman</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Lucas Lerman, Lindsey Lerman</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Logan Wade Lerman , Loggie</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/loganlerman</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/loganlerman</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38297872340426><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/loganlerman/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0503567</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28070175438596><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/logan-lerman-mn0003004837</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Awards</td><td>Young Artist Award for the Best Ensemble in a Feature Film, San Diego Film Critics Society Award for the Best Performance by an Ensemble, Teen Choice Award for the Choice Movie Actor in Drama</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Nominations</td><td>MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss, MTV Movie Award for Best Fight, MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Moment, Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Liplock, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, Critics' Choice...</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>‘Jack & Bobby’, ‘The Butterfly Effect’, ‘The Number 23’, ‘What Women Want’, ‘Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief’ , ‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>Jack & Bobby, Paramount The Animated Series</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Blue eyes</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=42.557613168724><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=8.7265193370166><td>1</td><td>[on his similarity to his character, Marcus, in <a href=#>Indignation</a> (2016)] I share very similar views to Marcus. I come from a Jewish family, as well. I definitely identify myself as being Jewish, and I'm proud of my background. But I have the same questions as Marcus has in his mind about life and religion. I'm questioning - I question things and I have no answers.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>2</td><td>[on not enjoying watching his own work] I didn't watch Perks until it was released... I really liked it, but felt uncomfortable watching it. I know it's a character and everything, but it's still uncomfortable to watch... That's kind of how I feel about Fury right now.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>3</td><td>[on his similarities to his character in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)] I guess with his awkwardness and trying to figure things out in that time period and how to socialize and fit in. I guess I wasn't as naive as him, but I definitely had the morals that he had... A lot of situations in the script have actually happened to me in real life, so I just connected with it.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>4</td><td>I've always been able to just go off for a couple of months, shoot a film, go back to school and have my regular life. My family thought it was really important to have that level of normalcy. You kind of need to keep that in order to even tap into a character, let alone be a functioning human being.</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>5</td><td>I play music. I love learning a new instrument and creating songs; it also goes hand in hand with filmmaking, like creating a feeling and emotion in music to complement a scene. Songwriting, guitar, piano, bass, ukulele, a little bit of violin, a little bit of everything - primarily guitar and piano. It's just a hobby for now, maybe it would turn into a profession someday... who knows.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>6</td><td>They say every year you put off university is like three years if you want to go back. But, for now, this seems like the right path.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>7</td><td>Some people don't have an open mind, and when I was traveling to different places I think I found it hard to enjoy things. You know, I come from a great city where there are lots of things happening, and if you end up in a small town where you don't have all those things you can feel the difference. Somewhere along the way, though, I think I learned to appreciate the difference.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>8</td><td>I'm from Los Angeles and acting was accessible. There's always a place to wait in line for an audition and I kind of begged my parents to take me. My mom nurtured my career and helped me climb the ladder.

I first got interested in acting when I was probably four or five.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>9</td><td>I just don't want to repeat the same thing over and over again, so I'm always looking for something that's going to be challenging and make me nervous every time I start a project.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>10</td><td>The best thing about this is being able to learn from, and act with, your heroes.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>11</td><td>I'm not the kind of guy who got into this to be famous.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>12</td><td>[Portraying a geek is] "Fun.

That would be my sport of choice.</td></tr><tr readability=2.6949152542373><td>14</td><td>[about his character in <a href=#>Jack & Bobby</a> (2004)] "The kind of boy few people really understand.
