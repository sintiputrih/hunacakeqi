Having prominently dated Maroon 5’s Adam Levine, British-Irish boy band leader Max George, and Leonardo DiCaprio in the past, she is lately talked about for her recent romance with controversial online celebrity and professional wrestler Logan Paul.</p><p>Nina’s parents, meanwhile, between all of this have rarely been mentioned. Their stories have seldom made it to fans’ ears. So, in the rest of the writing, we thought we would tell you everything that you may have been wondering about.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Nina Agdal’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Nina Agdal was born to Jes Brohus and Anne-Mette Agdal on 26 March 1992. All of them have been inseparable since.</p><p>One can tell there is no love lost between Nina and her parents. She occasionally shows them off to her followers online. Every opportunity they get, her folks too like telling the world just how proud they are of her.</p><h3><strong>Meet Jes Brohus, Nina Agdal Dad</strong></h3><p>Jes Brohus was not on Instagram as of August 2023, but he did have a <a href=#>Facebook</a> account. And over here he mentioned Silkeborg, Denmark as his hometown and Bramming City in Denmark as his current dwelling place. Back in November 2015, when he visited his daughter Nina in New York, she was so glad that she also documented the moment on IG. And most lately (March 2023) when Nina’s famous beau flew to Denmark with Nina to meet Jes and the rest of the family, he nearly “suffered a mental breakdown”.</p><p>During an episode of Kevin Hart’s vlog, Logan revealed the breakdown. Kevin asked him “Did you ever reach a breaking point?” and Logan answered with “It’s funny you ask that right now. Two weeks ago I had a little bit of a breakdown.” He explained how when they Denmark, he “just” had a breakdown one night and was not in the headspace to meet Nina’s dad for the first time. What happened further he did not reveal.</p><h3><strong>Meet Anne-Mette Agdal, Nina Agdal’s Mom</strong></h3><p>Anne-Mette Agdal is the daughter of Jørgen Nielsen (later Agdal, the son of an unknown father and Herdis Ketty Nielsen born in Ringkøbing, west Denmark) and Lona Agdal (the daughter of Tage Andersen, later Agdal, and of Astrid Dorthea Frederikke Bruun born in Frederiksberg, Denmark).</p><p>Anne’s job, on LinkedIn, is translated into English as “owner of Agdal Tours, tour guide, tour organizer, experience designer and local guide on Lolland and Falster”. Indeed, she has been working full-time as a tourist guide and in other rights in travels and tours since leaving her job in Mortgage at Nordea Bank in March 2017.</p><p>On her IG <a href=#>@agdaltours</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Facebook</a>, she has been gladly showing glimpses of her life, her love for fashion, traveling, interior design, and just about everything.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Do Nina Agdal’s Parents Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Nina Agdal’s parents have not been staying together it seems. Nina’s dad Jes Brohus on his Facebook, mentioned Silkeborg, Denmark as his hometown and Bramming as his current city. The latter is a railway town in Southern Denmark.</p><p>Nina’s mother on the other hand only cited the fact that she moved to Maribo in Denmark in 2016.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Many Kids Do Nina Agdal Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Nina Agdal is not the only child of her parents. There is also <a href=#>Emil Brohus Agdal</a>, Nina’s brother. He can be found on IG <a href=#>@emilagdal</a>. Since December 2020, Emil has been working as a full-time procurement and logistics specialist at Fremsyn Aps in Denmark.

They are likely no longer together. It is also not understood when they got married and for how long they stayed like that.</p><p>Nina’s fans often have had discussions over her ethnicity. So, let us also go through this one more time. Nina was born and raised in Denmark. It was actually also there (in Hillerød) that she was scouted. She was signed with a Danish model agency before her 18th birthday. After that Nin moved to the United States to shift her modeling career there. Then, 2012 was the year she made her first magazine appearance as “Rookie of the Year” in the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.</p><p>From that time onward, Nina’s career drastically boomed and saw her collaborate with other notable models like Chrissy Teigen and Lily Aldridge. Eventually, people also started following massively on social media for her fitness and health-related content.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, she enjoyed as much as 1.9 million followers on her IG <a href=#>@ninaagdal</a>. Here, just on 9 July 2023, she reposted her beau Logan’s IG post where he gushed “Engaged to my best friend 💍 @ninaagdal.” This included a series of beautifully captured moments from Logan’s proposal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmp6Gelnqis8Oao2aokaeyr8DSZpuanF2fsrR5waumoa2jYrqwuYyapaedXaKytcDEZpignJGhfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./golden-globes-2013-exclusive-see-stars-backstage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Golden Globes 2013 Exclusive: See the Stars Backstage!">&larr;
