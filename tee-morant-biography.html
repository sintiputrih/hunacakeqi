He has made a name for himself as a former college basketball player and, more notably, as the proud father of NBA star Ja Morant.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Morant’s unwavering support for his son is evident as he passionately cheers him on from the front row during games, always keeping a keen eye on Ja’s performances. </span><span style=font-weight:400>As a former player himself, Morant has a deep understanding of the game in his role as both a supporter and a critic. He recognises the potential in Ja’s talent and constantly pushes him to reach new heights.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>While Morant’s love for his son shines through his unwavering support, he also possesses a discerning eye that allows him to provide constructive criticism when necessary. </span><span style=font-weight:400>With a desire to see Ja continually improve, Morant offers valuable insights and guidance to help shape his son’s game.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>While his words might seem like constructive criticism of Ja’s performances, basketball spectators are always shocked by how harsh his words are whenever he speaks of his son.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>Morant once said that </span><a href=# rel=noopener><i><span style=font-weight:400>Ja played like trash. Trash! </span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400>after the Memphis Grizzlies played against the Minnesota Timberwolves.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Asides from the way he criticises his son, Morant is also known for ‘exchanging words’ with NBA players and players’ parents.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Andrea Hernangomez: Princess of renowned Spanish basketball dynasty</a></span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>For instance, during a game between the LA Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies, Morant got into an </span><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel=noopener>argument with NFL legend, Shannon Sharpe.</a></span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.skabash.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/A5BEFA9E-759E-48B1-8F3D-1A4693EE6E33-664x462.jpeg alt="Tee Morant shaking hands with Ja Morant" width=664 height=462 title="Tee Morant: Father who is his son’s biggest ‘hater’ 3" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span id=Tee_Morant_career><strong>Tee Morant career</strong></span></h2><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Morant honed his skills on the court from a young age. He had the privilege of playing alongside the renowned Ray Allen during their time at Hillcrest High School in Dalzell. Their collaboration proved to be formidable as they led their team to victory, clinching the </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>state championship in the 1992-93 season.</span></a></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Morant got admitted to Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina, and continued his basketball journey. There, he showcased his skills as a member of the university’s basketball team and left a lasting impact on the court.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>His commitment to the game and the victories he achieved at both the high school and collegiate levels stand as a testament to his talent and hard work.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>After graduating in 1998, Morant set his sights on pursuing a professional basketball career. He attended an NBA camp, hoping to impress scouts and secure a spot on a team. However, he received feedback that he did not meet the height requirements that teams were seeking. Despite this setback, Morant remained determined to continue his basketball journey.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Seeking opportunities to showcase his skills, &nbsp;Morant joined a </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>semi-professional team in Colombia. </span></a><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;He, however, encountered difficulties with player salaries and faced challenges during his time in South America. It became clear that pursuing a professional basketball career overseas was not the ideal path for him.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>During this critical juncture in Morant’s life, he received life-changing news: Jamie Morant, his partner, was expecting their son. The impending arrival of their child prompted Morant to make a significant decision.<br></span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>He chose to prioritise his role as a father and create a stable environment for his growing family. With a newfound sense of purpose, Morant decided to settle down in Dalzell and dedicated himself to raising his son.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.skabash.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4D9EFE78-2D41-4705-A06F-D7FD1F128A33-600x400.jpeg alt="Tee Morant sitting courtside at a basketball game" width=600 height=400 title="Tee Morant: Father who is his son’s biggest ‘hater’ 4" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Alongside his responsibilities as a father, Morant also became a barber. This allowed him to provide for his family while pursuing his passion for basketball in a different capacity.<br></span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Recognising his son’s inherent love for the game, Morant assumed the role of Ja Morant’s trainer. Even at a young age, it was evident that the younger Morant was infatuated with basketball and the older Morant fostered that passion by playing with him on their backyard court from the tender age of three.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Through his unwavering support and early involvement in Ja Morant’s basketball journey, Morant laid the foundation for the budding talent that his son would later become.</span></p><h2 style=font-weight:400><span id=Tee_Morants_net_worth><strong>Tee Morant’s net worth</strong></span></h2><p>According to Media Referee, Tee Morant has an estimated net worth of $5 million.</p><h2><span id=Tee_Morant_family><strong>Tee Morant family</strong></span></h2><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Morant’s family is filled with basketball lovers and players.

He gained prominence during his college career at </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Murray State University,</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> where he showcased his exceptional skills and athleticism on the basketball court. As a point guard, Morant’s electrifying performances and highlight-reel dunks captured the attention of basketball enthusiasts and NBA scouts alike.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>After two impressive seasons at Murray State, Ja Morant was on the list for NBA Draft in 2019.
