They include corrected and uncorrected design errors, repeating ink misprints, and other production errors. The list of "Corrected Errors" includes design errors that saw a correction within the same print run and any notable ink errors known to occur. These cards have a very limited production size and oftentimes offer a rare glimpse into a moment from a print run. The list of "Uncorrected Errors" are mass-produced cards that never saw a correction within the same print run, making them notable, but not rare or desirable to collectors. Errors listed on the Official TCG Errata document are denoted by <i>(Erratum)</i>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Original_Series>Original Series</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Base_Set><a href=# title="Base Set (TCG)">Base Set</a></span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/6/65/BS68Vulpix-HP50.png/375px-BS68Vulpix-HP50.png decoding=async width=250 height=356 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# title="Vulpix (Base Set 68)">Vulpix</a> listed with "HP 50" instead of "50 HP".<p><b>Corrected errors</b>:</p><ul><li><b><a href=# title="Blastoise (Base Set 2)">Blastoise</a></b>: "Illustrator Error Blastoise". The word "Illus." can be missing from the bottom left corner of unlimited prints. Much rarer than the "Stage Error Blastoise".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Blastoise (Base Set 2)">Blastoise</a></b>: "Red Dot Blastoise". A small red ink dot above Hydro Pump attack's water energy symbol can be found on unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Blastoise (Base Set 2)">Blastoise</a></b>: "Stage Error Blastoise". The word "Stage" can be missing from the top right corner on unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Chansey (Base Set 3)">Chansey</a></b>: "Black Dot Chansey".

A big black ink blob can be found covering the "no" of "now Asleep." in the Sing attack on unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Clefairy (Base Set 5)">Clefairy</a></b>: "Red Heart Clefairy". A magenta ink printer hickey coincidentally resembling a heart with a circle can be found above the artwork on rare unlimited prints. The most desirable copies are the ones with a thick full circle and heart because the error can be very faded.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Gyarados (Base Set 6)">Gyarados</a></b>: Low black ink/Gray print error can be found on unlimited prints. Another error is a red dot on the bottom border of some unlimited prints, directly under the "96" in the copyright.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Hitmonchan (Base Set 7)">Hitmonchan</a></b>: Low black ink/Gray print error can be found on unlimited prints. Another error is a large holobleed over the "HP" and fighting energy symbol at the top right of some unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Machamp (Base Set 8)">Machamp</a></b>: "Green Dot Machamp". A blue-green ink blob over the "H" in "HP" at the top right of unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Machamp (Base Set 8)">Machamp</a></b>: "Screen Holo Machamp". A yellow "screen" of vertical ink lines can be found across some unlimited prints giving the holos a very unique effect.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Mewtwo (Base Set 10)">Mewtwo</a></b>: Blue ink streaks can be found on the holo background on unlimited prints. Low black ink/gray print errors can also be found on unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Ninetales (Base Set 12)">Ninetales</a></b>: "No Damage Ninetales". The number "80" is missing from the Fire Blast attack on some shadowless prints found from Brushfire theme decks.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Ninetales (Base Set 12)">Ninetales</a></b>: A black ink hickey obstructing the "es" in "Ninetales" can be found on some unlimited prints. Unlimited Ninetales can also be found with a yellow hair looking obstruction at the bottom right of the card. Additionally, unlimited Ninetales can be found as a gray text or low black ink error.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Venusaur (Base Set 15)">Venusaur</a></b>: Blue ovals of missing yellow ink can be found scattered across unlimited prints. Caused by water drip obstructions on the yellow plate.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Beedrill (Base Set 17)">Beedrill</a></b>: "D.efending Error Beedrill". A rare design error where some unlimited prints were accidentally printed with a period on "D.efending" in the Poison Sting attack.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Dragonair (Base Set 18)">Dragonair</a></b>: "Rainbow Smear Dragonair". A rainbow-like smudge covering the letter "u" in the word "number" on 1st edition and shadowless prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Electrode (Base Set 21)">Electrode</a></b>: Blue ink hickey on Electrode's right cheek on some unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Charmeleon (Base Set 24)">Charmeleon</a></b>: "Blue Slash Charmeleon". Two blue ink streaks across Charmeleon's body possibly from two hair obstructions on the blue layer.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Charmeleon (Base Set 24)">Charmeleon</a></b>: "Red Heart Tattoo Charmeleon". Unlimited print red ink hickey coincidentally resembling a heart on Charmeleon's left hip.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Charmeleon (Base Set 24)">Charmeleon</a></b>: A small red printer hickey near the set symbol area can be found on unlimited prints. All copies of this error are also noticeably red saturated which likely resulted in the magenta ink blot hickey.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Poliwhirl (Base Set 38)">Poliwhirl</a></b>: Blue ink hickey at the top right over the word "Pokémon" on unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Wartortle (Base Set 42)">Wartortle</a></b>: "Evolution Box Wartortle". A corrected design error where a short print run of English unlimited print accidentally had the evolution box showing Wartortle's image instead of Squirtle at the top left. Notably, all Portuguese 1st edition and unlimited prints have this error as well, hinting towards a common print facility.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Wartortle (Base Set 42)">Wartortle</a></b>: A blue ink hickey at the top right of unlimited prints. It's the same size as the water energy symbol just to the right.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Abra (Base Set 43)">Abra</a></b>: "Jet Plane Abra". A small black dot coincidentally resembling a jet plane can be found in the sky left of Abra on unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Bulbasaur (Base Set 44)">Bulbasaur</a></b>: "Shadowless Sunbeam Bulbasaur". Shadowless error with two yellow streaks of missing blue ink over Bulbasaur's body. All copies also have an identical column of missing gloss over Bulbasaur's body.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Charmander (Base Set 46)">Charmander</a></b>: "Scratch Error Charmander". Half the “h” in “Scratch” attack can be found missing along with the red ink smeared on unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Charmander (Base Set 46)">Charmander</a></b>: There are multiple repeating magenta printer hickey errors in unlimited print. One is over the "h" in "Scratch" attack. A second is over the "Mit" in Mitsuhiro at the bottom left corner. A third can be found above the "50 HP" at the top right.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Diglett (Base Set 47)">Diglett</a></b>: "Rotated Energy Symbol Error Diglett". A design error where the Fighting Energy symbol for the Dig attack can be found rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from a print run of unlimited "2-Player Starter Set" boxes.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Machop (Base Set 52)">Machop</a></b>: "Yellow Belly Machop". An additional yellow ink smudge on Machop's belly can be found on unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Magnemite (Base Set 53)">Magnemite</a></b>: A blue ink printer hickey on Magnemite's forehead on unlimited print.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Pikachu (Base Set 58)">Pikachu</a></b>: "Ghost Stamp Pikachu". A yellow cheeks shadowless design error with an incomplete 1st edition stamp reading only the outline of "E ITION", missing the "1" and the "D." This error has been found inside gold-strip shadowless "Zap!" theme decks.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Pikachu (Base Set 58)">Pikachu</a></b>: A few unlimited cards have been found with a medium sized yellow ink hickey over the word "Pikachu" in its Thunder Jolt attack.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Ponyta (Base Set 60)">Ponyta</a></b>: A medium sized magenta printer hickey can be found in the sky above Ponyta's tail of unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Rattata (Base Set 61)">Rattata</a></b>: Two small magenta ink dots can be found in varying degrees above the set symbol area of shadowless prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Squirtle (Base Set 63)">Squirtle</a></b>: "Red Diamond Squirtle". A small diamond of red ink can be found over the "ve" in "prevent" in the Withdraw attack of shadowless prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Squirtle (Base Set 63)">Squirtle</a></b>: Unlimited Squirtle can be found missing the "tle" of its name.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Staryu (Base Set 65)">Staryu</a></b>: A magenta printer hickey can be found at the top left corner of the artwork of unlimited prints.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Tangela (Base Set 66)">Tangela</a></b>: "Blue Stain Tangela". A large blue ink stain hickey can be found on the artwork at the right side of unlimited prints. This is one of the largest repeating printer hickies in the set.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Vulpix (Base Set 68)">Vulpix</a></b>: "Blue Butt Vulpix". A blue ink obstruction can be found on Vulpix's butt on both 1st edition and shadowless prints. The 1st edition is notably more rare.</li><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Water Energy (Base Set 102)">Water Energy</a></b>: "Water Energy Misalignment Error". A mass produced design error where the top banner was accidentally misaligned higher than intended, resulting in the energy symbol being too high and the banner missing the edge design at the top, left, and right side.</li><li><b>Back Stamps</b>: 1st edition commons and uncommons can be found with a 1st edition stamp inverted on the back of the card. The black ink evidently didn't fully dry before the sheets were stacked, leading to wet ink transfer. Some cards received additional black ink and some had their ink removed to be "white stamps."</li><li><b>Base 2000 UK Yellow Shifts</b>: Commons from the 1999-2000 UK prints can be found with a severe yellow ink shift to the right and downward in varying amounts. Only about 10 have been found and none of them were first partner Pokémon, making a finding of one very rare.</li><li><b>Crimps</b>: Some booster packs contained cards that were misaligned when the pack was sealed, causing the crimps used to seal the pack to also be present on the cards. The most common crimp found in packs distributed by Wizards of the Coast is Unlimited Machamp. The pack rares are hardest to find crimped, most likely due to being in the middle of the pack. "Vertical crimps" and "Longstem hanger crimps" are also very rare crimps to find, most times happening on the uncommon card. "Crimped and cut" cards were so misaligned in the pack wrapper that they were cut with the booster pack. These cards often were not cut all the way, leaving behind a cut mark and sometimes a double crimp from the second pack.</li><li><b>Dark Gold Border</b>: Some Shadowless nonholo rares, uncommons, and commons have been found printed with extremely dark gold borders. A recent occurrence was from a shadowless 2-Player Starter Set deck. Unlimited Machamp holos are also known to rarely have this border error as well as 1st edition common cards.</li><li><b>Gray Stamps</b>: 1st editions can be found as a gray stamp or low ink 1st edition stamp error. The 32 rares from the set are extremely hard to find compared to the nonholos. Unlimited Machamp cards can also be found with this error.</li><li><b>Holo Shifts</b>: The unlimited holos can be found with an extreme foil shift in varying degrees all but Machamp. Holo shifts are the result of a misaligned white ink layer.</li><li><b>Inverted Backs</b>: All the unlimited holos, uncommons, and commons have been found having an upside down back and being majorly off-center. The error is actually an inverted front because the backs are standardly printed first.</li><li><b>White Stamps</b>: Similar to the "Back Stamps," these 1st edition commons and uncommons can be found with the 1st edition stamps partially white on the front and on the back. Due to missing ink from wet ink transfer, these are most commonly found on the back, compared to rarely being found white on the front.</li><li><b>Yellow Saturated Holos</b>: Most of the unlimited holos have been found with extremely oversaturated yellow ink across the whole card.</li><li><b>Yellow Stain Shadowless Holos</b>: Most of the shadowless holos have been found with vertical yellow ink lines across the card. Some have a lot of lines while others only have one.</li></ul><p><b>Uncorrected errors</b>:</p><ul><li><b><a href=# title="Blastoise (Base Set 2)">Blastoise</a></b>: German versions of the card erroneously state that Water energy can be attached to any Pokémon instead of only Water-type Pokémon.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Gyarados (Base Set 6)">Gyarados</a></b>: All Base Set Gyarados were printed with the "6/102" too far to the left.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Machamp (Base Set 8)">Machamp</a></b>: The shadowless version has the Fighting symbols in all four of the Fighting Energy symbols noticeably shifted to the right.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Kakuna (Base Set 33)">Kakuna</a></b>: In the 1st Edition and shadowless versions of this card, the bio incorrectly reads "Length: 22 lbs" instead of "Weight: 22 lbs".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Bulbasaur (Base Set 44)">Bulbasaur</a></b>: In the 1st Edition and shadowless versions of this card, the bio incorrectly reads "Length: 15 lbs" instead of "Weight: 15 lbs".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Caterpie (Base Set 45)">Caterpie</a></b>: The 1st Edition and Shadowless versions of this card have their HP listed as "HP 40" instead of "40 HP".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Metapod (Base Set 54)">Metapod</a></b>: The 1st Edition and shadowless versions of this card have their HP listed as "HP 70" instead of "70 HP".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Nidoran♂ (Base Set 55)">Nidoran♂</a></b>: Nidoran♂ is misformatted as "Nidoran ♂".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Sandshrew (Base Set 62)">Sandshrew</a></b>: The move Sand-attack on the 1st Edition and Shadowless versions of this card reads "this attack does nothing" instead of "that attack does nothing".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Voltorb (Base Set 67)">Voltorb</a></b>: In the 1st Edition and Shadowless versions of this card, the Bio at the bottom of the card reads "Easily mistaken for a Monster Ball", using the Japanese name for <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Balls</a> instead of the English name. The unlimited version was corrected, with "Monster Ball" being replaced with "Poké Ball."</li><li><b><a href=# title="Vulpix (Base Set 68)">Vulpix</a></b>: The 1st Edition, Shadowless, and unlimited prints have their HP printed as "HP 50" instead of "50 HP". This was only corrected in the UK released 1999-2000 4th print run.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Imposter Professor Oak (Base Set 73)">Imposter Professor Oak</a></b>: The 1st Edition and Shadowless versions of this card read "Impostor Oak" instead of "Imposter Oak".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Bill (Base Set 91)">Bill</a></b>: All versions of this card, including Legendary Collection, have a white space under Bill's left arm where part of the background was intended to be instead.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Switch (Base Set 95)">Switch</a></b>: The 1st Edition and Shadowless versions of this card read "Switch 1 of your own Benched Pokémon with your Active Pokémon." The word "own" was later removed in the unlimited versions of this card.</li><li><b>Japanese Evolution Box Errors</b>: All the Japanese holo cards of evolving Pokémon have the holographic overlapping the bottom of the evolution box.</li></ul><p><b>Variants incorrectly regarded as errors</b>:</p><ul><li><b><a href=# title="Machamp (Base Set 8)">Machamp</a></b>: "Cosmos Holo Machamp". Base Set was printed using the starlight holofoil pattern. However, some Machamp cards were printed with the Cosmos holofoil pattern instead. These Machamp cards were found inside the 2-Player CD-ROM Starter Set deck. This deck contained Base Set 2 cards and a reprint of the unlimited Machamp with Base Set 2's cosmos pattern.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Ninetales (Base Set 12)">Ninetales</a></b>: "Black Flame Ninetales". A rarer variant only found on unlimited prints where the flames of the artwork are black like the shadowless artwork instead of blue like most of the unlimited prints. <a href=# title="Wizards of the Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a>, the distributor of Pokémon cards at the time, changed the design at some point early during unlimited print, making the black flame Ninetales less common.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Pikachu (Base Set 58)">Pikachu</a></b>: "Red Cheeks Pikachu". A variant found on 1st edition, shadowless, and the E3 promo prints that is often regarded as an error. The illustrator of the card, <a href=# title="Mitsuhiro Arita">Mitsuhiro Arita</a>, originally submitted the artwork of the Base Set Pikachu with yellow cheeks. Wizards of the Coast employees thought the cheeks were supposed to be red, so they changed their color to red without Arita's permission. Eventually, it was switched back to having yellow cheeks as Arita had originally intended. Pikachu's cheeks turn yellow during an attack, which explains why Arita wanted them to be yellow. Because this was an intentional design change, it should not be considered an error.</li></ul><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Jungle><a href=# title="Jungle (TCG)">Jungle</a></span></h3><p><b>Corrected errors</b>:</p><ul><li><b><a href=# title="Clefable (Jungle 1)">Clefable</a></b>: The prerelease promo holo has been found with both shifted and inverted prerelease stamps.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Flareon (Jungle 3)">Flareon</a></b>: Unlimited holo Flareon can be found with multiple magenta ink hickies with white rings in the background of the artwork.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Kangaskhan (Jungle 5)">Kangaskhan</a></b>: A few unlimited holos were found with the left side of the artwork as nonholo due to additional white undercoat ink. The same error happened on Snorlax.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Pinsir (Jungle 9)">Pinsir</a></b>: A number of 1st edition holo Pinsir cards have holo-like scratches that can be seen going above and through the 1st edition stamp.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Snorlax (Jungle 11)">Snorlax</a></b>: A few unlimited holos were found with the left side of the artwork printed with a nonholo portion due to additional white undercoat ink. The same error happened on Kangaskhan.</li><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Clefable (Jungle 17)">Clefable</a></b>: A handful of unlimited nonholo Clefable cards were printed with a red ink mark on Clefable's body.</li><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Kangaskhan (Jungle 21)">Kangaskhan</a></b>: "Green Spear Kangaskhan". A number of unlimited nonholo cards were printed with a horizontal streak of missing magenta ink resembling a green spear in Kangaskhan's hand. There is also a subtle red streak right above it from missing cyan ink.</li><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Snorlax (Jungle 27)">Snorlax</a></b>: "Yellow Highlighter Snorlax". A number of unlimited nonholo Snorlax cards were printed with a large streak of missing magenta ink, making it look like the bottom left of the artwork had been drawn on with yellow highlighter.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Butterfree (Jungle 33)">Butterfree</a></b>: "'d' Edition Butterfree". Due to a small ink obstruction hickey, a large number of 1st edition cards were printed with a ring in the 1st edition stamp making, the 1 look like a "d". One of the most common errors found on cards distributed by Wizards of the Coast. Undoubtedly, over 100 copies of this error exist.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Persian (Jungle 42)">Persian</a></b>: A few unlimited cards were found with a yellow ink ring resembling a fruit hanging in the tree above Persian's tail.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Weepinbell (Jungle 48)">Weepinbell</a></b>: A few unlimited cards have been found with a medium-sized yellow ring under the "R" in its Razor Leaf attack from a blue hickey.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Eevee (Jungle 51)">Eevee</a></b>: "'d' Edition Eevee". A handful of Eevee cards have been found with a small ink hickey circle in the 1st edition stamp that vaguely resembles the stamp error seen on Butterfree.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Exeggcute (Jungle 52)">Exeggcute</a></b>: Many unlimited cards were printed with a green dot and a yellow ring above the artwork from a cyan ink hickey. Pop&lt;30</li><li><b><a href=# title="Exeggcute (Jungle 52)">Exeggcute</a></b>: A few unlimited cards were found with a large yellow vertical stain on the left side of the card.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Jigglypuff (Jungle 54)">Jigglypuff</a></b>: A couple unlimited cards were found with a blue oval at the end of the left tree branch. Caused by missing yellow ink.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Oddish (Jungle 58)">Oddish</a></b>: A few unlimited cards were found with a black ink hickey ring over the 1'8" of its length stat.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Paras (Jungle 59)">Paras</a></b>: A significant amount of unlimited cards were found with the exact same missing black ink sections around the jungle symbol and the "20" in its attack. Pop estimate&lt;10.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Pikachu (Jungle 60)">Pikachu</a></b>: A handful of unlimited cards were found with a small red ink hickey resembling tweezers above the "u" in its name. The red V shape was likely caused by a small hair obstruction on the magenta blanket cylinder. Known population estimate&lt;5.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Venonat (Jungle 63)">Venonat</a></b>: A good amount of 1st edition cards have been found with a long vertical black ink line running along the top left side on the yellow border. The line was likely caused by a hair obstruction being on the black blanket cylinder. Estimation of population&lt;20.</li><li><b>Crimps</b>: An unlimited uncommon card has been found with a long crimp from a hanger long stem booster pack. Normal booster box pack crimps are the only other known crimp found in the Jungle set almost equally common to find on the uncommon and common card. The rare card has only been found several times with a partial crimp.</li><li><b>Holo Shifts</b>: A handful of unlimited holo cards have been found with a misaligned holo effect. These are highly regarded as the error grails for each set.</li><li><b>Inverted Backs (Fronts)</b>: A handful of unlimited holos have been found having an upside down inverted back and being majorly off-center. The error is actually an inverted front because the backs are standardly printed first. There is also at least one example of this error happening on the unlimited Jungle PCD nonholo sheet, giving the possibility of some Oddish, Gloom, Bellsprout, Weepinbell, Nidoran♀, Nidorina, Meowth, Persian, Rhyhorn, Rhydon, and Eevee cards having this error.</li><li><b>No Symbol Errors</b>: A large print run of unlimited Jungle holo rares was printed without the Jungle symbol designed into the black plate. A handful have been found with missing yellow ink ovals usually found by finding blue ovals on the grass type Pokémon.</li><li><b>Pink Back Rares</b>: A handful of 1st edition nonholo rares have been found with a major magenta ink stain horizontally across the back middle of the card.

This Black Star promo #1 can only be found as 1st edition from the 1st ed. Jungle booster packs. For many years, this was assumed to have been an error card not meant to have been in the packs due to it being the only black star promo with a 1st edition stamp. However, the emergence of a prototype Jungle booster pack, together with evidence found in a Japanese magazine, suggests the card was an intentional secret rare chase card that was never advertised in America. The evidence was found in a Japanese publication "Pokémon Card Trainers Vol. 2" in an article showcasing the upcoming North American release of the Jungle set expansion. The prototype booster packs include text on the Poké Ball graphic reading "Capture the rare Pikachu card! Look on inside wrapper!". Most recently on June 7, 2021 Twitch user murkd_ was opening 1st edition Jungle booster packs on stream and opened 3 packs each containing 3 1st Edition Ivy Pikachu cards (9 total), each filling the pack's usual uncommon card slots. According to PSA, the graded population is over 230.</li></ul><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Fossil><a href=# title="Fossil (TCG)">Fossil</a></span></h3><p><b>Corrected errors</b>:</p><ul><li><b><a href=# title="Gengar (Fossil 5)">Gengar</a></b>: A few holos have been found with a large yellow ink hickey on the back of the card at the top of the "MO" in POKÉMON. It closely resembles the shape of an arm flexing or a slanted yellow 7 with a yellow line around it. Notably, three identical copies have been found, with one being 1st edition and two being unlimited.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Haunter (Fossil 6)">Haunter</a></b>: "Blue Stain Haunter". A large number of unlimited holos were printed with a large blue ink stain at the bottom right corner of the artwork near Haunter's hand. The most severe examples have the blue ink bleeding all the way to the right of the yellow frame into the purple area, while the least severe examples have small blue hickey circles or streaks in the holo. With every sheet that was printed, the ink slowly diminished until all the additional ink was gone. This is one of the largest and most popular ink stains found on cards distributed by Wizards of the Coast.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Haunter (Fossil 6)">Haunter</a></b>: "Yellow Stain Haunter". A handful of 1st edition holos were printed with a vertical gold border ink stain varying in severity on the left side of the card like on Hitmonlee, but much rarer. With every sheet that was printed, the ink slowly diminished until all the additional ink was gone.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Hitmonlee (Fossil 7)">Hitmonlee</a></b>: "Stainmonlee". A small amount of 1st edition holos were printed with vertical gold border ink stains varying in severity on the left side of the card. Only a few severe examples have been found with two stains covering from Hitmonlee's foot all the way down to the bottom border, while the most common form of this error only has the stain right below the artwork covering the word "Stretch" of its Stretch Kick attack. With every sheet that was printed, the ink slowly diminished until all the additional ink was gone.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Zapdos (Fossil 15)">Zapdos</a></b>: "Nonholo Evolution Box Misprint". All 1st edition Zapdos holos have a misprint at the top left corner of the artwork which was accidentally designed with a nonholo section where an evolution box would have been for an evolving Pokémon. This misprint was also mass produced for unlimited print and mass produced as a corrected unlimited print. Neither are rare to find.</li><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ditto (Fossil 18)">Ditto</a></b>: A few unlimited nonholos were found with a small pink ring from a blue ink hickey right above Ditto's head in the artwork background.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Sandslash (Fossil 41)">Sandslash</a></b>: A handful of unlimited copies were found with between 7 to 10 small black dots after weakness, reading "weakness . . . . . . . resistance".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Seadra (Fossil 42)">Seadra</a></b>: A few unlimited copies have been found with a medium sized blue ink hickey at the bottom left of the card covering the words "Capable of" and "pectoral".</li><li><b><a href=# title="Krabby (Fossil 51)">Krabby</a></b>: Some unlimited Krabby cards have an incomplete Fossil set symbol.

(This error doesn't apply to the internationally released prints of this card.)</li><li><b>Blurry Art Rares</b>: Some unlimited nonholo rares have been found with color misregistration shifts errors to the left in respect to the black and border ink, causing the art to be blurry. There are two variations for this error with the first being the magenta and yellow ink are shifted left the same amount. The second variation also has cyan shifted left with the magenta and yellow.</li><li><b>Cosmos Fossil Holos</b>: Some unlimited holos were printed with the incorrect cosmos foil pattern. English Fossil holos were printed with the starlight holofoil pattern, but some were printed with the cosmos foil pattern instead. It is unclear if this was done in error, as test prints, or if Wizards of the Coast intentionally switched to a different holofoil. These are highly sought after grails to collectors.</li><li><b>Holo Bleed Water Spill Obstructions</b>: A handful of unlimited holos have been found with massive holobleeds from missing sections of white ink. These sections are typically horizontal swaths or ovals of missing white ink caused by water obstructions. The white plate's water roller would have spilled or dripped out too much water on the plate.</li><li><b>Inverted Back Holos (Fronts)</b>: The unlimited holos have been found with upside down backs. The back and front of the sheet don't often align evenly, so when inverted, the back can be majorly off-center down and to the right. The backs are standardly printed first, so the error is someone feeding the front of the sheet into the printer upside down.</li><li><b>No Star Holos</b>: Also known as "Mirror Holos," found on both 1st edition and unlimited holos, these cards are missing some, or in rarer cases, all the stars in the holofoil pattern. Fossil is the most common Wizards of the Coast set that this error has been found in.</li><li><b>Orange HP Error Uncommons</b>: A handful of unlimited uncommons have been found with significantly low magenta ink across the whole card, making the HP bright orange and significantly affecting the coloration of some artworks. The magenta dots of ink on these cards are smaller than usual, making them appear sunfaded.</li><li><b>White Line Border Holos</b>: Some 1st edition and unlimited holos have been found with a sharp white vertical line of missing ink on the left border. This is caused by the holofoil being glued abnormally far to the right, which causes the gold border's ink roller to miss the card while rolling over the edge of the foil.</li></ul><p><b>Uncorrected errors</b>:</p><ul><li><b><a href=# title="Zapdos (Fossil 15)">Zapdos</a></b>: All 1st edition holos were accidentally designed with a nonholo section at the top left corner of the artwork where the evolution box would be for an evolving Pokémon.</li><li><b>Japanese Fossil Holofoil Cards</b>: All of the holofoil cards with an evolution box were accidentally designed with the holographic overlapping the bottom on the evolution box.</li></ul><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Base_Set_2><a href=# title="Base Set 2 (TCG)">Base Set 2</a></span></h3><p><b>Corrected errors</b>:</p><ul><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Charizard (Base Set 2 4)">Charizard</a></b>: A few copies have been found with the same additional white ink smear across the holo making a section of nonholo.
