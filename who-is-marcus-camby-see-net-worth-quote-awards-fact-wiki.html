Camby was born on the 22nd March 1974, in Hartford, Connecticut USA, and is probably best recognized for being a retired professional basketball player, who played in the positions of center and power forward in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for such teams as the Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, etc. His playing career was active from 1996 to 2013.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Marcus Camby is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Marcus’ net worth is over $50 million, an amount which has been accumulated mostly through his successful career in the sports industry as a professional basketball player.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=marcus-camby-net-worth-50-million></span>Marcus Camby Net Worth $50 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Marcus Camby spent his childhood in his hometown, attending Conard High School in West Hartford before transferring to Hartford Public High School, from which he matriculated. While in high school, Marcus excelled as a basketball player, and finished his senior year averaging 27 points, 11 rebounds, 8 assists and 8 blocks per game, and so earned Gatorade’s Connecticut Player of the Year award. Right after high school, he enrolled at the UMass Minutemen, where he spent three seasons, having an NCAA freshman record of 105 rejections in total; so, he was named the Atlantic 10’s Freshman of the Year. Beside that, he also received the John R. Wooden Award, as well as the Naismith College Player of the Year Award.</p><p>Marcus’ professional playing career began with the 1996 NBA Draft, in which he was selected as the second overall pick by the Toronto Raptors, playing for the Raptors until the end of the 1997-1998 season, after which he was traded to the New York Knicks. While with the Raptors, his net worth increased to a large degree, as he was the NBA block leader in his second season, averaging 3.7 blocked shots per game. With the Knicks, his numbers drastically dropped, but the reason was that he was used as a substitute for the all-star center Patrick Ewing. The two led the Nicks to the NBA finals, which they lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games. Nevertheless, all of these added a considerable amount to his net worth.</p><p>After a few relatively mediocre seasons at the New York Knicks, he joined the Denver Nuggets, and alongside Carmelo Anthony who was a rookie at the time, helped the Nuggets on both ends of the field and reached playoffs. After the Denver Nuggets, he joined the Los Angeles Clippers, however, his numbers started to decline, and as a result he was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, and then signed a two year contract to remain with the Blazers, but just before his contract expired he was sent to the Houston Rockets. After that, his game was never the same, and several injuries led to the end of his career in 2013, when he was waived by the Rockets.</p><p>Marcus stood out as a more defensive player than offensive, and earned several awards in that part of the game, including the NBA All-Defensive First Team in 2007 and 2008, while also being the blocks leader from 2006 until 2008, consecutively.</p><p>Speaking about his personal life, Marcus Camby is married to Eva Camby, with whom he has two children. Their current residence is in Pearland, Texas. He is known for his charity work, as he established the Cambyland Foundation in 1996, which helps students with education. In his spare time, Marcus is active on his official Twitter account.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Marcus Camby</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$1.4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 22, 1974</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Hartford, Connecticut, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6′ 11″ (2.11 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>107 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Massachusetts Amherst, Hartford Public High School, Conard High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Eva Camby</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Maya Camby, Milan Camby</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Janice Camby, Ames Manderville</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Mia Camby, Monica Camby</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/marcuscamby23</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2328990/</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, NBA All-Defensive Team, NBA All-Rookie Team, Naismith Men’s College Player of the Year, John R.
