Their season aired a few years back, and fans have grown curious about the pair and whether they are still married.</p><p>Let's take a look at Greg and Deonna and see if they're still together.</p><h2 id=39-married-at-first-sight-39-had-a-wild-season-9>'Married At First Sight' Had A Wild Season 9</h2><p>Married at First Sight is a reality show that has had its share of wild and entertaining seasons, and the 9th season of the show is one that can certainly lay claim to this. There were some great couples, some chaotic couples, and a whole lot of drama that helped shape the season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When taking a look back at the most memorable moments from the season, there is simply no ignoring the drama that unfolded between Matt and Amber. In short, Matt was absent and completely unavailable, leaving Amber devastated throughout the entire process.</p><p>It's also worth taking a look at the marriage between Jamie and Elizabeth, which was passionate in every way. The love was deep, as was the chaos between the pair.</p><p>Through it all, season nine had some excellent moments, and it left an impression on the fans at home.</p><p>Once the dust finally settled from season nine, there was one couple, in particular, that became a fan favorite thanks to the amount of love that they shared.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight' Star Jessika Power Shares Adorable Tribute To Boyfriend Connor Thompson</a></span></p><h2 id=greg-and-deonna-were-couples-goals>Greg And Deonna Were Couples Goals</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every once in a while, the expert stick the landing, and this was precisely the case when they matched Greg and Deonna.</p><p>"Gregory, 32, was raised in a single-parent household with his sister and mother, where they were heavily involved in the church. He works as the owner of a math learning center and considers himself an entrepreneur. Not one to shy away from conflict, Gregory also considers himself a good communicator. He has previously been engaged for 2 years, but is ready to find love with the right woman," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifetime</a> wrote for his bio.</p><p>"Deonna, 30, strongly values her family and considers them to have played a strong part in who she is today. She’s well-traveled, career-oriented and works as an operations manager to support herself. Although she hasn’t dated in 10 years, she’s ready to walk down the aisle for the right God-fearing man," the network wrote about Deonna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly, these two were a perfect pair. The fire might not have seemed strong at first, but the slow simmer ultimately paid off. These two moved at their own pace, allowed themselves the chance to fall in love, and with their values and principles in line, they forged one of the most unforgettable romances in the show's history.</p><p>At the end of the show, these two chose to stay married. It's been years since season nine was on the air, and fans want to know if they're still married.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Married At First Sight: Are Briana And Vincent Still Married?</a></span></p><h2 id=are-they-still-married>Are They Still Married?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, are Greg and Deonna still married to one another? A quick look over at their profiles on social media will reveal that they are, in fact, still married! Not only that, but their family unit has gotten a bit bigger since the show.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, "Devoted parents at first sight! Deonna McNeill and Greg Okotie, Married at First Sight season 9 alums, welcomed their first child, son Declan Okotie, at 8:44 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 27, their rep confirms to PEOPLE. The newborn weighed 6 lbs., 9 oz., at birth."</p><p>This was back in 2019, and the couple was excited to share their big news with the world.</p><p>"We are so blessed and excited to welcome our baby boy, Declan, into the world. We're all healthy and doing well, just happy to be home as a family of three!" the couple said.</p><p>It is genuinely amazing to see how things played out for this couple. Again, they were more of a slow simmer, but clearly, the experts knew what they were doing when they matched this perfect pair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': What Really Happened At Isabella And Tyler's Crazy Honeymoon Island Drama</a></span></p><p>Greg and Deonna are proof that Married at First Sight can find the right person for someone bold enough to go on the show.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Bao Tells Johnny She Wants A Divorce, And She's Not The Only One!</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqinrKlecCtZJ%2BhoqjBbr%2FIoJ%2BtZZGnsm6z0Z6eZpmemXqlsc6npZplo6m2rbiMppirqpmasXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./302102-lou-williams-officially-trademarks-lemon-pepper-lou-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lou Williams Officially Trademarks &amp;quot;Lemon Pepper Lou&amp;quot;">&larr;
