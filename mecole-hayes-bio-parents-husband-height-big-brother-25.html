How tall is she?</p><p>Get answers to these questions and more in the article below!</p><h3><strong>Mecole Hayes On Big Brother 25</strong></h3><p>Announcing her participation in Big Brother 25, Mecole took to IG and shared, “IT’S OFFICIAL!!! 💛 I’m so happy to announce that I will be spending my summer in the Big Brother house! 🏠 Tune in to Big Brother season 25 this Wednesday, August 2nd on CBS and Paramount+! 🏖”</p><p>Mecole expressed similar excitement over the season in her interview with parade.com. She said, “I am so excited to be on the iconic BB 25th season. I’m excited for all of the twists and turns. I’m sure we’re going to see some things from the past and maybe some things from the future pop up. So, I’m really excited for what’s to come.”</p><p>Watching Xavier and Taylor from previous seasons win the show, Mecole decided to participate in the show. According to her, she couldn’t let go of the chance of winning $750,000. She believed the odds were in her favor.</p><p>By her admission, Mecole was going to play the show like a politician. In a tongue-in-cheek tone, she joked about stabbing fellow contestants in the back and running away with their money.</p><p>Mecole, in her own words, is a combination of Tiffany Xavier, Britney, and Janelle, but a little bit of Tyra Banks.</p><h3><strong>Mecole Hayes Age</strong></h3><p>In the summer of 2023, Mecole Hayes turned 30 years of age.</p><h3><strong>Mecole Hayes Parents</strong></h3><p>According to Mecole Hayes, her parents are neither African nor Ethiopian. She claims they are “regular black folks from St.Louis, Missouri.”</p><p>Mecole, pronounced ME-COLE, insists that her name is a combination of her parents’ names. In fact, she argues that their names are much prettier.</p><p>Mecole’s mother is Tonya G Winn, a resident of Saint Louis, MO. “I love my mommy. I really am a momma’s girl,” wrote Mecole once to express her love to Tonya.</p><p>53 years old as of 2023, Tonya is her daughter’s favorite. She even cared for Mecole’s Aunty Willie, who passed away in 2014 at the age of 99.</p><p>Tonya also has multiple children (Mecole’s siblings). However, there doesn’t seem to be enough about them online. A similar case is for Mecole’s father, who turned 50 in 2023.</p><p>Mecole’s known family members/relatives include Letricia Hayes, Nichelle Hayes, and Jaerst C Winn of Chicago, IL.</p><h3><strong>Mecole Hayes Husband</strong></h3><p>Damien Snyder is the husband of Big Brother 25 star Mecole Hayes.</p><p>In June 2023, Mecole and Damien tied the knot in Columbia, IL. In what appeared to be an all-black event, Damien’s uncle & mentor Reverend Benjamin Snyder was the officiant at their wedding. Meanwhile, Jessica Carter & Casey Sanders served as the bridesmaids. Hayers Capers and Riccardo Walker, on the other hand, were the designated groomsmen.</p><p>Mecole met her future husband, at U-Street in Washington, D.C. Their meet-cute is well documented on the knot.com. An excerpt from the website read, “Meme caught Damien’s eye while standing alone at the bar after a failed girl’s night out. Just as she was preparing to leave and go crawl into bed, Damien made his way next to her and asked, “So you’re just going to walk past me without telling me your name?”, and the rest was history.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mecole-hayes-husband-300x244.jpg><p>Damien, as noted on his LinkedIn, is a Senior Information System Security Officer at Open Systems Technologies Corporation.

Following the win, she shared, “When I started my pageantry journey, I had no idea that I would end up here.” She then thanked her mother and her now-husband for their support.</p><h3><strong>Mecole Hayes Job</strong></h3><p>Mecole Hayes is an Advocacy Manager at National PTA.
