His net worth could be expected to be a small amount in the years to come as his profile continues to rise.&nbsp;Gathegi has also received a number of awards and nominations throughout his career.&nbsp;One of them is his award for Leading Role at the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – girlfriend, wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Gathegi looks like a little lady is known about his private life.&nbsp;The talented actor has kept his personal life very personal, deterring distress from media sources.&nbsp;Despite his friendliness to the ladies, Gathegi, the middle child in his family, never showed up to any lady.&nbsp;This may mean that he is not in a romantic relationship with anyone.&nbsp;The verifiable information about Gathegi is that he is not married at the moment and has no child of his own.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight, body stats</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Gathegi has a good stature which perfectly matches his acting profession.&nbsp;He stands at a height of 6′ 1” which is quite proportional to his weight of 59 kg.&nbsp;From the description it can be deduced that the slim figure of the actor undoubtedly gives him an advantage over his peers.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMnpuiZZeWwamxxqJkoKGiobOztcSnm2avmZuybrLApqClsV2XvKXFjKyrmqyjYrWmtcahq2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=next><a href=./aviana-olea-le-gallo-mother-father-henry-cavill.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Amy Adams Daughter Aviana Olea Le Gallo?
