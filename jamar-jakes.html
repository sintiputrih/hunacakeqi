Jamar Jakes is one of five children born to The Potter House pastor TD Jakes. TD Jakes is a famous American bishop, author, and filmmaker.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Jamar Jakes was born on&nbsp;<strong>January 4, 1979,&nbsp;</strong>in the United States of America. His age is <strong>43 years old</strong> and is under the birth sign, Capricorn. He holds an American nationality.</p><p>Jamar’s father’s name is T.D. Jakes and his mother’s name is Serita Jakes. Likewise, he has four siblings and their names are Sarah, Jermaine, Cora, and Thomas. His father is a famous American bishop, author, and filmmaker. Moreover, Sarah is a self-help author and Cora is a religious author. And his other two siblings are known as celebrity kids as well. Moreover, Jamar is popular because of his father. Furthermore, Jamar was born in the year 1979, but his parents wouldn’t get married until the year 1981. Because his father had been preaching part-time at the time.</p><p>Regarding Jamar’s educational background and qualification, the name of the educational institutions he attended is not available as of now. And considering his age, Jakes must have graduated from both high school and university until and unless he is a dropout or decided to quit further studies.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-95800 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jamar-Jakes-Family.jpg alt="Jamar Jakes" width=650 height=371 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-95800 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jamar Jakes along with his family (Source: Marriedbiography)</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Jamar Jakes has served as the general manager for The Potter House and as the director of business development for TD Jakes Enterprises. However, he has always kept his profile and personal background very private and low. That is why very little information related to his personal life and profile is available to the world. Likewise, Jamar only became popular because of his father, Jamar Jakes. Moreover, Jake’s’s profession and the works he does are also not known. Maybe he wants to keep his life as private as possible and live a normal life.</p><p>Talking about his father, Thomas Dexter Jakes Sr. is a famous American bishop, author, and filmmaker. He is the bishop of The Potter’s House which is a non-denominational American megachurch. Likewise, Jakes’s church services and evangelistic sermons are broadcast on The Potter’s Touch. Likewise, T.D. Jakes became the pastor of Greater Emanuel Temple of Faith, a storefront church in Smithers, West Virginia, along with ten members when he was ten years old. And since then, his career began and is rising.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-95799 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jamar-Jakes-Studio.jpg alt="Jamar Jakes" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-95799 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jamar Jakes in a studio (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p>Focusing on his earnings and income, his exact <strong>net worth</strong> is not available until now. Similarly, his income source is also unknown to us.</p><p>Despite, being a famous personality, he hasn’t been endorsed by any brands till now. Hope he might be involved in some of the brand endorsements in the coming future.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Jamar Jakes is possibly <strong>single</strong> at the moment and seems to be more focused on his career and life rather than being in a relationship. Considering his age, he must have been married as well. However, we cannot be sure as he has not revealed anything related to his love life. Or maybe Jamar wants to keep his personal and love life private and away from the public. Even focusing on his past relationships, no information has come forward until now. So, we can petty much assume that either Jamar has never been in a relationship or has done a good job in keeping it a secret.</p><h2><span id=Jamar_Jakes_8211_Body_Measurements>Jamar Jakes – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>The body measurements of Jamar such as his <strong>height</strong>, weight, chest size, waist size, hip size, bicep size, and any other sizes are not available until now. And all these unknown body measurements of Jake are still under review. Moreover, Jamar has black hair and dark brown eyes.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-95798 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jamar-Jakes-Pose.jpg alt="Jamar Jakes" width=650 height=433 data-wp-editing=1 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-95798 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jamar posing for a picture (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Jamar_Jakes_8211_Social_Media>Jamar Jakes – Social Media</span></h2><p>Jamar is pretty active on all of his social accounts.
