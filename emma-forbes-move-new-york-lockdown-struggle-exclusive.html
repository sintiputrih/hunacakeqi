Less is more.</strong> Not to sweat the small stuff, which I definitely used to do! I've also learnt to be happy in my own company and to press the pause button and that kindness is really the best currency we have - never has it meant more."</p><p id=eblNeJgMA5EQ data-wc=68>Discussing her lifestyle podcast, which has featured guests such as Julie Walters, David Furnish and Ruby Wax, the mum-of-two said: "The podcast is a feel good chat with wonderful guests about what gives them life, what feeds their soul, how they've coped and adapted during this strange time and a chance to have a heart to heart on the way their life works for them!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d96b32e4ae1a-emma-forbes-beach-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=efauDUZ-yFRE data-wc=10><strong>The presenter is loving her new set-up in the States</strong></p><p id=etQ_Zo1QVyPG data-wc=68>She continued: <strong>"The inspiration behind it was that I wanted to spread the word of ways in which people feel good, have changed their lives, done something different as it was what I was craving to hear myself... </strong>and so I decided to be a facilitator if you like to be able to interview these people that I admire from all walks of life and share their info!!"</p><p id=e5BHSwkHuBb4 data-wc=39>On what fans can expect soon, Emma shared: "We have some fantastic upcoming guests including Fearne Cotton, Jay Rayner, Susannah Constantine, Dr Alex George, Holly Tucker and the lovely Andi Peters who I worked with back in the day."</p><p id=e4p-2fOING6P data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
