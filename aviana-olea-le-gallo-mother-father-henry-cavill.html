She quit ballet dancing as soon as she was ten. She recently turned 11 years old.</span></span></p><p><span>Find out more about Amy Adams' daughter Aviana Olea Le Gallo.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Darren Le Gallo Celebrates His Daughter Aviana’s 11th&nbsp;birthday</strong></span></h2><p><span>Amy Adams married her husband, Darren Le Gallo, on 2 May 2015, and their then 5-year-old daughter, Aviana, was there to celebrate them on their big day. That was six years ago, and now Aviana has turned 11 years old just this year. Le Gallo took this celebration to his <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram account </a>along with a photo of Aviana, who looks a lot like her mother.</span></p><p><span><span>He captioned the post :</span></span></p><p><strong><span>“Happy Birthday Aviana!! *insert heart *insert birthday cake I can’t believe my girl is 11yrs old today!!! You are such an incredible human I’m so very proud of you Your spirit Your heart Your creativity I adore you #grateful (the last pic is from today-one of her BDay wishes was to go to the Art Gallery that re-opened today in Ireland *insert Ireland flag).”</span></strong></p><p><span>Her mother, Amy Adams, also didn’t back down to wish Aviana’s birthday. She also shared a post on her Instagram account alongside a black and white picture of the duo, <a href=# rel=noopener>captioning</a>,<strong> “Happy 11th Birthday Aviana. You constantly amaze me with your humour, intelligence and spirit. This day is a true celebration. I love you!”</strong></span></p><p><span>The couple rarely has shared the photo of their little girl. So the photos shared on Aviana’s 11</span><span><span>th</span><span>&nbsp;birthday can be considered as a rare photo the public has seen as of now.</span></span></p><h2><span><strong>Who Is Amy Adams' Daughter Aviana Olea Le Gallo?</strong></span></h2><p><span>Amy Adams and her at the time fiancé, Darren Le Gallo, had Aviana Olea Le Gallo in May 2010 after announcing the pregnancy in December 2009. “<strong>Mom and baby are home and doing great,”</strong> her rep told <a href=# rel=noopener>PEOPLE</a> at the time.<strong> “Everyone’s healthy and happy.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Since then, Darren has shared multiple pictures of Aviana, calling her <strong>“the best gift”</strong> and referring to her and Amy as “my two angels.” Aviana is the first and only child for the couple as of now.</span></p><p><span>Aviana Olea Le Gallo was born on 15 May 2010 in California, USA, and has just turned 11 this year.</span></p><p><span>After giving birth to her baby girl, Adams explained the meaning behind the name, revealing it paid tribute to Adams’ hometown of Aviano, Italy. While they have named her Aviana, the couple loves to call her by a nickname, Avi.</span></p><p><span>In January 2020, Amy, Darren, and their daughter Aviana<a href=# rel=noopener> celebrated the opening night of Darren’s new art exhibit</a>, titled <strong>“From Destruction,”</strong>&nbsp;in West Hollywood, California. The family of three posed together for photos at the exhibit, according to PEOPLE.</span></p><p><span>Her father, Darren, is an actor known for his work on The Matrix Reloaded (2003), Date Night (2010), and Trouble with the Curve (2012). He is also an artist known for “his dream-like paintings which delve into emotional states and the subconscious mind.” Like Darren, Aviana’s mother, Amy, is also an actress known for American Hustle (2013), Enchanted (2007), Man of Steel (2013), and such. She has appeared three times in the annual rankings of the world’s highest-paid actresses.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/amy-adams-daughter-aviana-olea-le-gallo-in-between-amy-and-her-husband-darren-le-gallo.jpg alt="amy adams daughter aviana olea le gallo in between amy and her husband darren le gallo" width=650 height=567 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Amy Adams daughter Aviana Olea Le Gallo in between Amy and her husband, Darren Le Gallo, in their wedding (©: Instagram/ Darren Le Gallo)</strong></span></p><p><span>When the duo first crossed paths in acting class, they were both dating other persons. They didn’t start dating until they shared a screen in Pennies, a short film. Their romance bloomed from there after having a date as they came to know that they were made for each other.</span></p><p><span>The couple made their first public appearance at the Oscars in March 2006. After dating for six years, the pair engaged in April 2008 and married in May 2015 after having their child in May 2010.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Aviana Olea Le Gallo Has A Huge Crush On Henry Cavill</strong></span></h2><p><span>In March 2016, Adams, while talking to ET, she revealed that her then-5-year-old daughter, Aviana, had a huge crush on Henry Cavill, who plays Superman. Aviana first met Henry when she was one and a half years. It was then when <a href=# rel=noopener>Aviana touched Henry's</a> booty when he was not looking.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, later in November that year, Adams said her kid’s taste in the opposite have changed as Henry Cavill was no longer her crush.<strong> “She doesn’t (have a crush on him) anymore, she makes it very clear. She’s like, ‘Do you remember that funny time when I thought Henry was cute?’”</strong> Aviana at the time preferred the actress’ Arrival co-star Jeremy Renner, as she <strong>“was much cooler about Jeremy. She’s older now. He has a little girl, so they ended up playing together, so she kinds of thinks of him as a dad,”</strong> Adams told.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46araKZnpZ6sLjEmmSlnV2crq24zmakqKyYmr9ussCtn56qXZ2yr77YZpqarpmhuQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Edi Gathegi?Girlfriend, wife, family, body stats, height">&larr;
