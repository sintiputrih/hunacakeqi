Keep reading and we shall explore more; even his family background, married life, career, and net worth-related details.</p><h3><strong>Comedian Vanessa Gonzalez Netflix’s Verified Stand Up</strong></h3><p>Vanessa Gonzalez has been really excited about her participation in Netflix’s Verified Stand Up. She has been teasing her trailer and promoting herself incessantly on social media.</p><p>Even prior, Vanessa had made a decent name for herself. She was named “Best Stand-Up Comic” in Austin by the Austin Chronicle in 2022.</p><p>Also, not many know about Vanessa that before becoming a professional comedian, she taught preschool for six years. Her sketch series, Ms. Vanessa, draws on her time teaching and has popped up in several sets over the years. She said she loved working with kids and teaching “definitely” influenced her as far as how she looks at things.</p><p>And once she started comedy, there also came a time in her career when she received an Insta­gram DM from Chelsea Han­dler ask­ing to be her open­er. She had to do a dou­ble take to make sure it was the real deal.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Comedian Vanessa Gonzalez’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Comedian Vanessa Gonzalez reportedly had less than $200K net worth as of December 2023.</p><p>Vanessa was drawn to comedy as a kid.

Growing up, she loved watching HBO specials, believing Chris Rock, Kathy Griffin, John Leguizamo, and Margaret Cho as huge influences and Def Comedy Jam was the best thing on TV. And then when it was time, she <span>started her career in Austin doing sketches with the Latino Comedy Project. That eventually led to an interest in improv and, eventually, to stand up. In 2017, she was voted Best Stand-Up Comic in the Chronicle’s “Best of Austin” Readers Poll.</span></p><h3><strong>Comedian Vanessa Gonzalez’s Age</strong></h3><p>Vanessa M Gonzalez was born in 1985.

So, clearly, at this point, she had a boyfriend.</p><p>In October 2019, Vanessa performed a show titled “Getting Underwear from Your Boyfriend” for Comedy Central.</p><p>Much earlier, in 2015, Vanessa in her show called “I Don’t Know Dat­ing” opened up that dat­ing can be weird, especially the part that going out with strangers, nev­er know­ing what the oth­er person is think­ing. She said it can be daunting sitting there won­der­ing if you are good enough, smart enough, or if you smell weird. It can all be very daunt­ing.</p><h3><strong>Comedian Vanessa Gonzalez’s Family</strong></h3><p>Vanessa Gonzalez loves her par­ents and they love her even more. Nonetheless, she does not let go of any chances of roasting them on set. She does that lovingly.</p><p>Vanessa’s parents support her so much that they reg­u­lar­ly make the 4‑hour drive from Lare­do to Austin to catch her com­e­dy shows. During one of her interviews, Vanessa also revealed adorably that her mom used to bring her con­grat­u­la­to­ry flow­ers after every set.</p><p>One time, Vanessa also opened up that her mom was diagnosed with cancer. She said that from the COVID pan­dem­ic and her mom being diag­nosed with can­cer to not being able to pay rent due to a lack of work, she felt that getting to tour was ​”too good to be true”.</p><p>We also learned that Vanessa has two brothers. One of them is Homer Gonzalez. He is Vanessa’s little brother. On his Facebook, he mentions that he has been communications coordinator at Waterloo Greenway&nbsp;since June 2019. It is also cited that he studied at Texas State University from 2012 until 2014. Also, as of 2023, she had been residing in San Marcos, Texas.</p><p>Another brother is Rene Gonzalez.
